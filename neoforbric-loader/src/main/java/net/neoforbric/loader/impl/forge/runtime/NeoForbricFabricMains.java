/**
 * Process-wide, run-once invoker of the Fabric {@code "main"} entrypoints, shared by BOTH ecosystems' registration
 * windows ({@code NeoForbricFabricWindow} for traditional-MinecraftForge, {@code NeoForbricNeoFabricWindow} for
 * NeoForge). Each window still opens/closes its own registry lock the ecosystem-specific way and calls
 * {@link #runOnce()} inside that span — but the actual {@code onInitialize()} calls happen at most once for the
 * whole JVM, guarded here.
 *
 * <p><b>Why a SHARED guard.</b> On the tri-in-one merged base BOTH lifecycles run (NeoForge's genuine lifecycle,
 * then Forge's via {@code NeoForbricDualLifecycle}), so BOTH bridge mods' {@code RegisterEvent} listeners fire, each
 * opening its own Fabric window. With a per-window guard the Fabric mods' {@code onInitialize()} would run twice —
 * double-registering their content and crashing. Whichever window opens first runs the mains (inside its unlock
 * span); the second finds the guard set and skips them, doing only its own ecosystem's bus/handler setup. On a
 * single-ecosystem instance only one window ever exists, so behaviour is identical to the old per-window guard.
