/**
 * Routes fabric-loader's {@link Log} — which {@link NeoForbricLog} writes to — into the game's log4j, the way
 * fabric-loader's own launcher does once the game is up.
 *
 * <p>Nothing else does that when NeoForbric boots the game itself — fabric-loader's own launcher is not the entry
 * point here — and fabric-loader's default handler is a buffer: it prints only once a message at ERROR arrives
 * (replaying what it held) or someone finishes its configuration, and otherwise keeps every line until the JVM
 * exits. Which is why a dedicated server's log never showed a single loader-side warning — the Fabric-mirror
 * exception that stalled a whole configuration handshake among them — while a client occasionally printed a burst
 * of them after some unrelated ERROR. Wired here, every line lands in the game log with the game's own timestamp,
 * thread and level, interleaved with everything else written to it.
 *
 * <p>Installs only when {@code Log} still holds its built-in handler (a launcher that already wired log4j keeps its
 * handler) and only when log4j is actually present (unit tests keep the built-in one). {@code Log.init} replays the
 * buffered lines into the new handler, so nothing logged before this class loaded is lost. Levels map one to one;
 * fabric-loader's DEBUG/TRACE are forwarded only under {@code -Dneoforbric.debug}, like {@link NeoForbricLog#debug}.
 *
 * <p>When there is no log4j to route into, nothing is printed: that is the normal case for tests and tooling, and a
 * line on stderr from every one of them would be noise. A host that expects the routing to succeed — anything that
 * launches the real game — can set {@code -Dneoforbric.logDiagnostics} to have that failure reported on stderr;
 * {@code -Dneoforbric.debug} and {@code -Dneoforbric.clientSmoke} imply it.
