 * NeoForbric's dedicated-server entry point. Runs unified discovery (reporting Fabric AND Forge mods), then
 * boots the game on the server side through the reused Fabric substrate (Knot).
 *
 * <p>Use this as the launch {@code mainClass} in place of {@code net.fabricmc.loader.impl.launch.knot.KnotServer}.
 * The dedicated server is the headless boot path: no natives/assets/GUI are required, and it is the cleanest
 * way to prove a game jar (e.g. the NeoForge-patched, Mojmap-named MC 26.2) loads under the substrate.
