# Assemble the Knot-loaded NeoForge runtime jar that NeoForbric loads at runtime (NeoForge is LGPL — it is
# fetched/assembled here and supplied at runtime, never committed into the Apache-2.0 loader source).
#
# It merges the NeoForge `-universal` jar (net.neoforged.neoforge.* — the API + the targets of the MC
# binary patches) with the FML/bus/coremod runtime libraries into ONE jar carrying a synthetic library
# `fabric.mod.json` (id "neoforge"), so Knot loads every net.neoforged.* class in its transforming
# classloader, co-located with the (Mojmap-native, patched) game classes. module-info/signatures are
# stripped and META-INF/services entries concatenated — EXCEPT org.spongepowered.asm.service.* (FML's
# mixin service bindings would fight the substrate's already-booted sponge-mixin under Knot). The
# universal jar's META-INF/neoforge.mods.toml is PRESERVED: NeoForge's ModSorter.detectSystemMods
# requires the "neoforge" system mod, and NeoForbric's genuine discovery builds it over this jar.
#
# Output: $OUT (default run/neoforge-runtime/neoforge-runtime.jar), cached — rebuilt only if missing, so
# DELETE IT when bumping the version below or you will keep shipping the old NeoForge.
#
# Pinned to NeoForge 26.2.0.88. The runtime lib versions below come from ITS userdev config.json; bump
# NF_VERSION and those versions together. (Six of the fourteen moved at this bump: fancymodloader
# loader/earlydisplay 11.0.13 -> 11.0.16, JarJarSelector/JarJarMetadata 0.5.0 -> 0.5.1, maven-artifact
# 3.9.9 -> 3.9.16, plexus-utils 3.5.1 -> 3.6.1. The config still lists exactly 40 entries and the same 14
# survive the "already on the classpath" filter, so nothing was added or dropped.)
#
# WHY .88, AND WHAT IT COST. This was 26.2.0.38-beta, chosen because .40-beta deleted
# net.neoforged.neoforge.client.event.ContainerScreenEvent and .43-beta deleted
# PlayerInteractEvent$EntityInteractSpecific, and the packs' jei / sophisticatedcore / sophisticatedbackpacks
# still referenced them. Two things changed:
#   * .57 and up are stable rather than beta, and the title screen brands the build it is running, so a beta
#     carrier says "beta" to every player.
#   * jei 30.32.0.215 now declares neoforge [26.2.0.67,) — the old pin no longer satisfies JEI at all, which
#     inverts the original argument: staying on .38-beta is what freezes the pack, not moving off it.
# Re-measured rather than assumed, .38-beta -> .88 removes 12 classes and adds 24. Of the 98 jars in
# run/client-merged-pack exactly two referenced anything removed (jei and sophisticatedcore, both
# ContainerScreenEvent); the current builds of all three of those mods reference none of it. Every `neoforge`
# versionRange declared anywhere in the pack is open above and below 26.3.0, so .88 satisfies all 45.
#
# The one thing the class diff caught that no mod would have: NeoForge moved client.gui.ModListScreen to
# client.gui.modlist.ModListScreen. The kernel's mods-button redirect names that class, and a wrong name there
# does not throw — see ForeignTypeCarrierTest, which now checks every ForeignType name against these jars.
#
# When bumping again, re-run both directions:
#     diff <(class list of the old neoforge-runtime.jar) <(class list of the new one)
#   and scan the mods for anything only the old side declares; then check every mod's declared `neoforge`
#   versionRange against the build being moved to, so an under-provisioned mod is named up front instead of
#   failing somewhere far away at runtime.
#
# Two libraries in that config.json are deliberately NOT listed below, because they already come from the parent
# classpath and not from this jar: they are the loader's own dependencies (neoforbric-loader declares both, and the
# installer stages them as `classpath` libraries), so the parent-loaded copy is the one NeoForge ends up seeing.
# Bumping NeoForge therefore means checking them, not copying them:
#   org.ow2.asm            .88 wants 9.10.1; neoforbric-loader/gradle.properties is 9.10.1. Match.
#   com.electronwill.night-config
#                          .88 wants 3.9.0; this tree pins 3.8.1. Measured again at this bump, not assumed: the
#                          universal jar plus fancymodloader loader 11.0.16 reference 70 distinct NightConfig
#                          members across 19 classes, and 3.8.1 provides all 70. 3.9.0 removes nothing and adds
#                          8 classes, none referenced. 3.8.1 stays, which also keeps --offline builds working.
#                          Re-run that comparison on the next bump: a NightConfig mismatch here is not a link
#                          error, it is the StampedConfig.valueMap() class of failure that took a whole session
#                          to find last time.
