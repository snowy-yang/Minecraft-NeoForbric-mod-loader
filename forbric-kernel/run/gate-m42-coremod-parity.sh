# M42 — what NeoForge's own coremods (and MinecraftForge's identical ones) do to the game, done by the kernel.
#
# Neither family's coremods run on the merged base, and its bodies are written for them. A dedicated server with a
# probe mod drives the game paths a player's actions reach and records each verdict (canary/coremod-parity):
#   flower pots — vanilla, a NeoForge-declared pot, an addPlant-declared pot, pick-block, NeoForge's getFullPot;
#   the liquid block's getter; spawn finalization of a counting probe mob — both families' events and exactly one
#   finalization carrying MinecraftForge's data from EntityType.spawn and /summon, a NeoForge cancel and a
#   MinecraftForge cancel (no finalization, mob still spawned), a NeoForge veto a MinecraftForge listener clears; a
#   NeoForge biome modifier (temperature, water colour, and what the network codec sends a client); a NeoForge
#   structure modifier; a Fabric weather change through the unmodified fabric-biome-api, which must survive NeoForge's
#   pass; and a biome climate replaced after the pass, which must win over it as it would on Fabric.
#
#   1. positive — STRICT, every case passes, zero confirmed required findings.
#   2. off — -Dforbric.coremodParity=off: every repaired case fails, and only the two Fabric climates (read raw) still
#      hold, so each case is shown to depend on the repair.
#   3. rebase-off — -Dforbric.biomeRebase=off: everything passes except the two Fabric climates, so the pass
#      bookkeeping (rebase and pass-time record) is what keeps them.
# Not covered here: the trial spawner (its helper is unit-tested, KernelFinalizeSpawnTest; no trial spawner runs in
# this world), natural and structure spawns (the redirect is unit-tested), and a rendered client.
