#!/usr/bin/env bash
# M19 gate — one library, nested by two ecosystems' mods, is initialised ONCE.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Each loader deduplicates only within its own family: KernelFabricLoader.register keeps the
# first Fabric mod id, KernelModLoader the first @Mod. Nobody was checking across, and DuplicateModArbiter — which
# is that judge — only walked mods/. A JarJar/JiJ child is not in mods/; it is extracted into .forbric-kernel/
# afterwards. So a library nested by a Fabric mod AND by a NeoForge mod loaded twice and was constructed
# twice.
#
# On a real 26.2 pack that was Xaero's: xaerominimap-fabric nests xaerolib-fabric while the NeoForge half nests
# xaerolib's own build, both claiming "xaerolib". The second construction threw "Attempted to register a duplicate
# config channel: xaerolib:main" — but only AFTER XaeroLib.<init> had already done INSTANCE = this, so a live
# mixin then called into a half-built object and took the client down on a render frame.
#
# No existing gate pack has that shape: every one of their nested duplicates is same-family (one fabric-api-base
# nested by five Fabric mods), which both loaders already handle. So the arbitration pass is a provable no-op on
# all of them and they would stay green through its removal. This gate stages the shape on purpose.
#
# It asserts BEHAVIOUR, not only the log line: the canary library carries a one-shot registry that throws on a
# second registration, the way xaerolib's config channel does.
