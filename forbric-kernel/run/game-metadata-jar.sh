#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Print the path to a RESOURCES-ONLY jar carrying the game's root metadata (version.json), generating it from the
# game base when missing or stale. Both launchers put it on the PARENT -cp.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Mods reach for the game's version.json through ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader(), because on
# the loaders they were built against the game jar is on the application classpath. Under Forbric it is not: the
# game base is handed to ForbricClassLoader via --gameJar, so a getSystemClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(
# "version.json") returns null and the mod silently falls back to a default.
#
# Measured cost of that: CustomSkinLoader's bootstrap picks its bytecode patch variant by PROTOCOL VERSION
# ("skin-manager.v1" claims [,763], "skin-manager.v2" claims [765,800],…). With version.json unreadable its
# protocol reads 0, which lands inside v1's open lower bound, so it applied a pre-1.20.2 pattern to 26.2, matched
# nothing, and threw `matched protocol 0 but did not modify any bytecode` — taking SkinManager and
# PlayerTabOverlay with it, i.e. skin loading. 26.2's real protocol is 776, which selects v2. Its documented
# fallback (net/minecraft/realms/RealmsSharedConstants) cannot help either: that class no longer exists.
#
# NO CLASS FILES, EVER. Putting the game base itself on the parent -cp would let the application loader win
# parent-first for game classes and quietly strip every mixin from them. This jar is asserted to be class-free
# below so that can never happen by accident.
#
# Usage: game-metadata-jar.sh <game-base.jar>   → prints the jar path on stdout (nothing else goes to stdout)
