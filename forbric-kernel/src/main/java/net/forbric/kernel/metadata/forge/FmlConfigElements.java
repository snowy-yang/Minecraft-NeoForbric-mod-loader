/**
 * What {@code IConfigurable.getConfigElement} answers, the way each FML's own {@code NightConfigWrapper} answers it,
 * for every object the kernel hands a mod in place of the one its FML would have built.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is one class and not four answers</h2>
 *
 * <p>A mod reads a {@code mods.toml} back through two different objects, and neither is optional. The mod's own
 * {@code [[mods]]} entry is {@code IModInfo.getConfig()}; the whole FILE is the owning {@code ModFileInfo}, which
 * natively delegates {@code getConfigElement} to a wrapper over the file's root table and answers
 * {@code getConfig()} with itself. The kernel builds two of each — the seeded NeoForge {@code LoadingModList}
 * entries, and its own {@code KernelModInfo} — and the file side of both answered empty (or, on
 * {@code KernelModFileInfo}, null).
 *
 * <p>That is not an abstract gap. Unlit Campfire keeps a lit campfire's burn time on its block entity, and declares a
 * top-level {@code ["lithium:options"]} table asking Lithium to switch off
 * {@code mixin.world.block_entity_ticking.sleeping.campfire}, the optimisation that stops idle campfire block
 * entities from ticking. Lithium's {@code NeoForgeMixinOverrides} walks {@code LoadingModList.getMods()} and asks
 * each mod's {@code getOwningFile().getConfigElement("lithium:options")}; the player's log said
 * {@code Loaded configuration file for Lithium: 171 options available, 0 override(s) found.}, and Lithium applied the
 * campfire mixins anyway. Not Enough Crashes asks {@code getOwningFile().getConfig()} for {@code issueTrackerURL} of
 * every mod it lists, and on a kernel mod that {@code getConfig()} was null.
 *
 * <h2>The answer</h2>
 *
 * <p>FML looks the path up as a LIST of literal keys ({@code getOptional(List)} / {@code get(List)}), so
 * {@code "lithium:options"} and iris' {@code "mixin.features.render.world.sky"} are one key each, never split on a
 * dot. A scalar or a list comes back as itself, a missing path as empty, and a table as its {@code valueMap()} —
 * NeoForge's {@code fancymodloader} answer. It does not descend, so a table one level further down is still
 * night-config's own {@code Config}.
 *
 * <p>Not modelled: the wrapper THROWS {@code InvalidModFileException} for a path that lands on an array of tables
 * ({@code "mods"}, {@code "mixins"}); this answers the list. A mod that asked for one would crash natively, so none
 * does.
