/**
 * Calls a vanilla method made itself that the surviving carrier absorbed into a static hook of its own, which the

 *
 * <p>{@link CarrierHelpers}' census rows are provable from the bytes: the call is the helper's first or last act, so
 * before or after the helper call IS before or after the call. Here it is not. NeoForge replaced
 * {@code FogRenderer.computeFogColor}'s final {@code dest.set(r, g, b, 1)} with {@code ClientHooks.getFogColor(...)},
 * which sets {@code dest} the same way and then lets fluid types and {@code ViewportEvent.ComputeFogColor} listeners
 * change it. An {@code @Inject} after the set can follow the hook call only on an argument about what the hook does
 * afterwards, and that argument is written down in {@code because}. MixinRetarget's R5 reads these rows for an
 * {@code @Inject} AFTER the call only; the census in MergedBaseAbsorbedCallsTest pins each row to the staged jars.
 * {@code -Dforbric.mixinAbsorbedCall=off} leaves every such point as compiled.
