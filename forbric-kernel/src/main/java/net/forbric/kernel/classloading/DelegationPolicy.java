/**
 * The explicit boot↔game delegation table for {@link ForbricClassLoader}.
 *
 * <p>This restates the old "Knot classloader split" law for the sovereign kernel: any class that links against
 * game / ecosystem types must be defined by the one transforming class loader that defines those types; anything
 * shared with the boot side (the transform machinery itself, the Mixin library, logging, the kernel's own boot
 * classes) must be parent-loaded so exactly one copy exists.
 *
 * <p>Policy (checked in order):
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>ALWAYS_PARENT</b> — never define here even if the bytes are reachable: the JDK, the ASM + Mixin
 *       libraries the transformer itself runs on, log4j/slf4j (one logging instance shared by game and kernel),
 *       NightConfig (a carrier bundles an old unshaded copy that would otherwise win child-first), the vendored
 *       Fabric mod-facing API, the few Fabric Loader internals the kernel ships ({@link FabricLoaderInternals}, by
 *       exact name), and the kernel's BOOT packages (everything under {@code net.forbric.kernel} EXCEPT
 *       {@code net.forbric.kernel.runtime}, which is game-side).</li>
 *   <li><b>ALWAYS_GAME</b> — always define here (with transforms), because these are the game + ecosystems and
 *       the kernel's game-side runtime: {@code net.minecraft}, {@code com.mojang.blaze3d},
 *       {@code net.neoforged}, {@code net.fabricmc.fabric}, {@code net.forbric.kernel.runtime}, and MixinExtras'
 *       generated-class package.</li>
 *   <li><b>otherwise</b> — child-first: define here iff the class is present in one of this loader's own jars,
 *       else delegate to the parent (this catches game/mod classes without hardcoding every package, and lets MC
 *       libraries like DataFixerUpper / Brigadier / netty / guava stay parent-loaded).</li>
 * </ol>

			// NightConfig class to that copy — shadowing the working 3.8.x on the parent classpath — while the
			// game side was compiled against 3.8.x, where valueMap() returns a real view. Any config read that
			// descends a dotted path into a sub-config then died: a mod's config file is stored as nested tables,
