/**
 * Answers a guest mod's "which loader am I running on?" question with the loader it was actually loaded as.
 *
 * <p>Multi-platform mods pick their platform branch by probing for a marker class:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * if (doesClassExist("net.neoforged.fml.loading.FMLLoader"))      use NeoForgeAbstractions;
 * if (doesClassExist("net.minecraftforge.fml.loading.FMLLoader")) use ForgeAbstractions;
 * if (doesClassExist("net.fabricmc.loader.api.FabricLoader"))     use FabricAbstractions;
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>On every real loader exactly one of those answers yes. On Forbric all three are live in one instance, so a
 * Fabric mod takes the Forge branch — code its author compiled against a different ABI and, on Fabric, never once
 * executed. Observed: Flashback nests {@code mixinconstraints}, whose {@code ForgeAbstractionsImpl} calls
 * {@code LoadingModList.get()} as a public static on a CLASS. Real MinecraftForge 26.2 declares
 * {@code LoadingModList} as an INTERFACE whose {@code get()} is private, so the JVM refuses the call site with
 * {@code IncompatibleClassChangeError: must be InterfaceMethodref constant}. That throw escaped the mod's mixin
 * config plugin, out through Mixin's {@code select()}, and aborted mixin config preparation for the whole game —
 * one wrong branch, a dozen unrelated-looking symptoms downstream.
 *
 * <p>So the kernel answers the probe honestly: a Fabric-owned class asking whether a Forge-family loader exists is
 * told no, and vice versa. That is the answer the mod would get on its own loader, which is the answer its code was
 * written and tested against.
 *
 * <h2>Why the answer is given at the call site, not in the class loader</h2>
 *
 * <p>Hooking {@link ForbricClassLoader#loadClass} looks like the obvious place and does not work: the kernel itself
 * loads both {@code FMLLoader}s while seeding, and {@code Class.forName} resolves an already-loaded class straight
 * out of the loader's dictionary without ever calling {@code loadClass}. So the rewrite happens where the mod asks
 * — {@link net.forbric.kernel.transform.LoaderProbeRewriter} redirects {@code Class.forName} inside single-family
 * guest classes to {@link #forName}, which applies this policy first.
 *
 * <h2>Only a question is answered, never a reference</h2>
 *
 * <p>Only an explicit {@code Class.forName} is answered this way — a question the mod asked out loud. A hard
 * bytecode reference still resolves normally, so a class that genuinely links against a Forge type keeps working
 * and never degrades into {@code NoClassDefFoundError}.
 *
 * <h2>Universal jars are exempt</h2>
 *
 * <p>A jar carrying more than one loader's manifest is genuinely multi-platform: its probes are how it finds out
 * which half of itself to run, and {@code MultiLoaderArbiter} has already picked its ecosystem. Those, the merged
 * base, the runtime carriers and the kernel's own classes have no family here and probe as before.
 *
 * <p>Escape hatch: {@code -Dforbric.loaderProbes=off} restores the pre-policy behaviour (every probe answers yes).

	 * {@code FORGE_FAMILY} constant on the reasoning that a NeoForge mod "is running on FML" and should be told
	 * yes when it probes for MinecraftForge's loader. That reasoning does not survive contact with the class
	 * names: the two families' marker classes are {@code net.minecraftforge.fml.loading.FMLLoader} and
	 * {@code net.neoforged.fml.loading.FMLLoader}, and on a real NeoForge instance the first one is absent. That
	 * probe is a mod asking "is TRADITIONAL Forge here", and the grouping answered yes to a NeoForge-only mod,
	 * sending it down the branch written for the other family.
	 *
	 * <p>The case the grouping was protecting — a genuinely multi-platform jar that probes to find out which half
	 * of itself to run — is already exempt by a different rule: a jar carrying more than one loader's manifest
	 * has no family here at all, and its probes are answered as before.
	 *
	 * <p>Not free to rename: {@link #name()} is baked into guest bytecode as an {@code LDC} by
	 * {@code LoaderProbeRewriter} and compared back here, so the constant is part of an already-transformed
	 * class's contract for the life of the process.
