/**
 * Which of a hook class's hooks the game base still CALLS, and which events therefore never get posted.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists</h2>
 *
 * <p>An ecosystem's event surface is two halves that live in different jars: the hook class (NeoForge's
 * {@code EventHooks}, {@code ClientHooks}) ships in the carrier and declares a static method per event; the CALL
 * SITES live in the game. A hook method can be present, still linkable, still callable by anyone, and never
 * called by anything.
 *
 * <p>A mod that subscribes to that event gets no exception, no warning, and no event. The surface is intact:
 * only the calls are gone. That is a defect you can only find by asking whether a call site EXISTS. The
 * comparison is absolute in the direction that matters: a constant pool either names the method or it does not,
 * so {@code dead} is a fact about bytecode, not a reading of prose or a log line.
 *
 * <h2>From dead hooks to dead events</h2>
 *
 * <p>A hook method posts its event by constructing it, so the {@code NEW} instructions in a hook's body name
 * the events that hook can post. An event is dead when EVERY hook that constructs it is dead — one surviving
 * call site anywhere is enough to keep it alive, which is why this cannot be answered one hook at a time.
 *
 * <p>Two honest limits, both of which make this UNDER-report deadness (it can call a dead event live, never the
 * reverse, so a finding here is always real):
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a hook handed an already-constructed event posts an event it never {@code NEW}s, so that event looks
 *       like it has no posters at all and is simply not judged;</li>
 *   <li>a call site the merge left in unreachable code still counts as a call site.</li>
 * </ul>
