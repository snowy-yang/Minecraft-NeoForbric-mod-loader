/**
 * The boot→game seam: every {@code net.forbric.kernel.runtime.} class the boot side names, and every method it
 * calls on one.
 *
 * <h2>Why a registry, and why it is checked at boot</h2>
 *
 * <p>The boot side cannot name a game-side class as a TYPE — that is the whole reason the game side exists — so
 * it names them as STRINGS: a {@code Class.forName} argument, a {@code getMethod} name, an ASM internal name.
 * Nothing in the compiler relates a string to the code that satisfies it. A string that has drifted produces no
 * error and no warning; it produces a {@code ClassNotFoundException} or {@code NoSuchMethodException} at the
 * moment of USE, which for these is the middle of a mod's construction.
 *
 * <p>Two failures are worth separating and both are caught here. A boot jar built on a machine with no staged
 * artifacts carries no {@code forbric-kernel-runtime.jar} at all — it launches, boots, loads mods, and dies on
 * the first game-side class with a message that names the class and says nothing about the build. And a
 * game-side method renamed without its caller produces the same shape of report one layer deeper. Checking the
 * whole seam once, right after the pipeline is assembled, turns both into one line at the top of the log.
 *
 * <p>This lists the SEAM, not the whole game side. A name belongs here when boot-side code spells it; the classes
 * a game-side class reaches on its own are ordinary Java to it, checked by javac, and listing them would be
 * listing things that cannot drift. {@code KernelRuntimeClassesTest} enforces that correspondence in both
 * directions — a registry nobody is forced to update goes stale silently, which is the defect it exists to
 * prevent, one level up.
 *
 * <p>{@link Origin#GENERATED} entries are deliberately NOT checked: they are emitted by a boot-side
 * {@code ClassWriter} on demand and are correctly absent from the jar. They are listed anyway so this file is the
 * one place that answers "what is on the game side, and how does it get there".
