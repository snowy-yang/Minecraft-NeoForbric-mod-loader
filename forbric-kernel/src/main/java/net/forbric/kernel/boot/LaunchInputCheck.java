/**
 * Whether the game jars this launch was handed are the ones a Forbric game is made of, judged by what is IN them and
 * before anything is loaded out of them.
 *
 * <h2>Why it exists</h2>
 *
 * <p>Issue #13. A player's installer was given a directory of unrelated jars, matched the three game files in it by
 * name alone, and staged two "runtime" jars that opened fine and held no Forge or NeoForge at all. The kernel took
 * them as given, and every step that read them had a legitimate empty answer: {@code EcosystemVersions} found no
 * manifest and said so at debug, the access transformers found none, Mixin found no config. The first class either
 * family owns was asked for inside {@link KernelRuntimeClasses#verify}, and its {@code NoClassDefFoundError} went to
 * stderr. The player's {@code latest.log} -- the only file a launcher collects -- was five INFO lines.
 *
 * <p>So the inputs are checked once, here, while nothing has been read out of them, and a launch that cannot work
 * stops with the reason and the fix in {@code latest.log} instead of a stack trace somewhere else.
 *
 * <h2>What "the right jars" means</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The game jar is the MERGED base: its {@code Block} implements an extension interface from each Forge family.
 *       Vanilla's implements neither, a NeoForge- or MinecraftForge-patched game one, and a jar that is not
 *       Minecraft has no {@code Block}.</li>
 *   <li>Every {@code --runtimeJar} carries at least one family completely: the loader SPI, {@code ModContainer},
 *       {@code FMLLoader}, {@code FMLEnvironment} and the family's own manifest. A jar with some of that is a broken
 *       carrier; a jar with only the manifest is one of that family's mods, which carry the same manifest; a jar
 *       with none of it is something else wearing a carrier's name.</li>
 *   <li>Both families are carried by something this launch owns. The merged base and the kernel's own game side
 *       name both, so a launch missing either cannot start -- that includes no {@code --runtimeJar} at all, and a
 *       launcher that kept only the last of two repeated flags.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>By content, never by file name: an installed profile passes {@code forge-runtime-26.2.jar}, a developer launch
 * {@code merged-base/forge-runtime-interop.jar}, and the names in the broken install were exactly right. Nor is it a
 * version or link check -- the installer's link gate is that. It asks only whether each jar is the kind of thing its
 * flag says it is, which is cheap enough to ask on every launch: one central directory per jar and one class read.
 *
 * <h2>What it does not catch</h2>
 *
 * <p>Five names per family are evidence of a carrier, not proof of a whole one. A jar that has them and lacks some
 * other class passes, and so does an entry whose bytes are damaged, a carrier from a different build than the
 * merged base, a base whose {@code Block} is intact and whose other classes are not, and anything wrong with the
 * libraries or the mods folder. Each of those fails where the missing piece is first used:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>In the kernel's own boot -- {@link KernelRuntimeClasses#verify} reports a class it cannot resolve, and
 *       {@link CompatibilityLaunchBoundary} logs anything else that leaves the boot, both into {@code latest.log}.
 *       The game crashes; it is not reported as a broken install.</li>
 *   <li>In the first three steps of the client's own {@code Main.main} (detecting the version, building and running
 *       the argument parser). Vanilla catches what they throw, prints it to stderr and exits with status 249, 252 or
 *       251, so nothing that ends the game there leaves {@code main}.
 *       {@code FMLEnvironment} is a marker for that reason: the merged base's {@code SharedConstants.<clinit>} --
 *       the first game code that runs -- calls NeoForge's, and a carrier without it ended the launch there with a
 *       {@code NoClassDefFoundError} on stderr and nothing in {@code latest.log}. MinecraftForge's is the one
 *       {@code PassiveSeeder} decides, which takes its absence for "no MinecraftForge" and says so only at debug.
 *       Any other failure on that path is put in the log by {@code LifecycleHookInjector}'s hook in
 *       {@code Main.logEarlyException} ({@link KernelLifecycle#onEarlyStartupFailure}), again as a crash.</li>
 *   <li>Anywhere after that: what leaves {@code main} is logged by the boundary, what the game catches by the game's
 *       own crash handling.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>{@code -Dforbric.launchInputCheck=off} reports the same problems as warnings and launches anyway.
