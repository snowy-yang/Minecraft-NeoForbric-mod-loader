/**
 * Serves the ecosystem jars' CLIENT ASSETS (shaders, textures, models, lang) to the real client
 * {@code PackRepository}.
 *
 * <p>Why: NeoForge's own {@code ResourcePackLoader.findResourcePacks} (its {@code mod_resources} source) is ORPHANED
 * on the merged base — nothing calls it, because the vanilla/Forge pack-repository construction won that merge. So
 * every ecosystem asset is unreachable. That is invisible until something actually needs one: NeoForge's
 * {@code NeoForgeRenderPipelines} registers pipelines whose shaders live at {@code assets/neoforge/shaders/*}, and
 * without them {@code ShaderManager.apply} throws "Failed to load required shader programs" and the client dies before
 * the title screen. Forge-family mod jars have the same problem for their own textures/models.
 *
 * <p>Fix: add one kernel {@code RepositorySource} carrying a distinct pack per jar, straight onto the real repo, at
 * {@code ClientModLoader.setupModResourcePacks(PackRepository)} — the vanilla-woven call inside
 * {@code Minecraft.<init>} made for exactly this, which the kernel redirects here (it used to be neutered). That is
 * before the client's first resource reload, which is the only timing that matters.
 *
 * <p>Compatibility is FORCED to {@code COMPATIBLE}: these jars carry boilerplate/ancient {@code pack.mcmeta}
 * {@code pack_format}s that MC 26.2 would otherwise reject (both genuine loaders force this too). All game types are
 * reached reflectively — the kernel's boot side has no compile-time Minecraft dependency.
