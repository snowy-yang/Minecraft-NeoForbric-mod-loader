/**
 * A full-power {@link MethodHandles.Lookup} whose lookup class lives on the GAME side.
 *
 * <p>Some ecosystem code (NeoForge's EventBus, which spins listener lambdas with {@code LambdaMetafactory}) requires
 * a full-power lookup — one holding the MODULE bit — over a class it is registering. A boot-side
 * {@code MethodHandles.lookup()} cannot produce that for a game class: teleporting it with
 * {@code privateLookupIn} across the boot→game module boundary drops the MODULE bit, and
 * {@code LambdaMetafactory} then rejects the caller ({@code LambdaConversionException: Invalid caller}).
 *
 * <p>The only way to mint a full-power lookup for a class is from code running in that class's own module. So the
 * helper whose {@code lookup()} is called lives in {@code net.forbric.kernel.runtime} — the kernel's game-side
 * source set, which {@code DelegationPolicy} pins {@code ALWAYS_GAME} — and is therefore defined by
 * {@link ForbricClassLoader}, in the game loader's unnamed module. {@link #privateLookupIn} then teleports that
 * WITHIN the game module, a full-power result LambdaMetafactory accepts.
 *
 * <p>The helper used to be emitted here as five ASM calls, because before the game-side source set had a
 * delivery path there was nowhere to compile it. It is now compiled from
 * {@code net.forbric.kernel.runtime.KernelGameLookupHelper} and carried inside the boot jar. Its absence is
 * reported ONCE at boot by {@link KernelRuntimeClasses}; the throw here is the second line of defence, and says
 * the same thing, because whoever reaches it may not have the top of the log.
