/**
 * Makes both Forge families' {@code ModList.isLoaded} answer for mods the OTHER ecosystem loaded.
 *
 * <p>{@code isLoaded} is the presence check Forge-family mods gate their compatibility branches on, and it reads
 * that family's own {@code indexedMods}. In this instance that map can only ever hold that family's mods, so a
 * NeoForge mod asking whether Sodium is installed is told no while a Fabric Sodium is running — and it then takes
 * the "no Sodium" branch, which is not a smaller feature but a wrong one. See {@code ModPresence} for why
 * that is invisible rather than loud.
 *
 * <p>The rewrite ORs the family's own answer with the kernel's cross-ecosystem one. Both operands are evaluated
 * (an {@code IOR}, not a short circuit), which is deliberate: it keeps the method BRANCH-FREE, so no stack map
 * frame has to be written for a merged control flow, and both calls are pure map lookups anyway.
 *
 * <p>Presence only: {@code getModContainerById} is left alone. There genuinely is no NeoForge container for a
 * Fabric mod, and inventing one would put a container with no event bus and no config where a caller expects a
 * real one. A mod that needs the container rather than the fact still gets an honest empty.
