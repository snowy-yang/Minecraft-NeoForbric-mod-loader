/**
 * Recomputes a mod's stack map frames when they name a superclass the merge took away.
 *
 * <p>A mod is compiled against ONE ecosystem's game jar, and the compiler bakes that hierarchy into the class
 * file: at a branch merge it writes the common supertype of the two incoming values into the
 * {@code StackMapTable}. The merged base has only one hierarchy, so wherever the two ecosystems gave a class a
 * different superclass, one side's mods carry a frame the merged base cannot satisfy — and the JVM rejects the
 * class at VERIFICATION, before a line of it runs, with a message that names a type the mod author never wrote.
 *
 * <p>Caught as {@code VerifyError: Inconsistent stackmap frames at branch target 46} in
 * InventoryProfilesNext's {@code ItemTypeExtensionsKt.initGroupIndex}: Kotlin had computed
 * {@code CapabilityProvider} as the common supertype of two {@code LocalPlayer} branches, because on
 * MinecraftForge {@code Entity extends CapabilityProvider$Entities}. The merged {@code Entity} extends
 * NeoForge's {@code AttachmentHolder}. The crash surfaced on opening the inventory and named Minecraft.
 *
 * <p><b>Recomputed, not patched.</b> Substituting one name for another cannot work: the merged
 * {@code ItemStack} still extends {@code CapabilityProvider$ItemStacks}, so {@code CapabilityProvider} is a
 * perfectly valid frame type for an ItemStack value and an invalid one for an Entity value, in the same class.
 * Only recomputing from the real hierarchy tells those apart. {@code COMPUTE_FRAMES} does exactly that, and its
 * answers are correct by construction rather than by the transformer's cleverness.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this may use {@code COMPUTE_FRAMES} when four other transformers refuse to.</b> They refuse because
 * {@code getCommonSuperClass} would have to resolve game types through a loader they do not have.
 * This one is handed a resolver over {@code ForbricClassLoader.getGameResourceAsStream}, which READS the class
 * file as a resource and never calls {@code loadClass} or {@code defineClass} — so the hierarchy walk cannot
 * re-enter the definition that is in progress.
 *
 * <p><b>The set of at-risk types is derived, not chosen.</b> For each class in the merged base, take its
 * ancestor chain in a single-ecosystem world (that ecosystem's patched base plus its carrier) and subtract its
 * chain in the merged world; whatever is left is an ancestor some mod may still name. Seven types come out of
 * today's artifacts. {@code CapabilityProvider$ItemStacks} is deliberately NOT among them — ItemStack kept it —
 * which is the case that proves the derivation is doing work.
 *
 * <p><b>A failure here abstains.</b> If the hierarchy cannot be walked, the original bytes are returned
 * unchanged. That is not timidity: {@code defineClass} does not verify, so a wrong recomputation would not fail
 * here either — it would fail at first link, somewhere else, with a message that no longer names the cause. The
 * original {@code VerifyError} at least says which class and which type.
 *
 * <p>For the same reason there is no "catch the VerifyError and retry" path, and there cannot be: by the time
 * the error fires the class is defined and the name is taken, so a second {@code defineClass} throws
 * "attempted duplicate class definition".
 *
 * <p>Known, deliberately not handled yet: {@code COMPUTE_FRAMES} also recomputes maxs and replaces unreachable
 * blocks with {@code NOP…ATHROW}, so a rewritten class's instruction list is not guaranteed byte-identical
 * outside the frames. Nothing observed this on the one class that needs it. The first time a rewritten class is
 * ALSO a mixin target, splice the original {@code Code} attributes back into the methods that carried no at-risk
 * frame.
