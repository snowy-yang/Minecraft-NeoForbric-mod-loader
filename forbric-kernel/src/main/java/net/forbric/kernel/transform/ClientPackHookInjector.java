/**
 * Redirects {@code ClientModLoader.setupModResourcePacks(PackRepository)} into the kernel, so the kernel can serve
 * the ecosystem jars' assets to the REAL client {@code PackRepository}.
 *
 * <p>{@code Minecraft.<init>} calls this genuine hook with the live repository, before the client's first resource
 * reload — exactly the point mod resources must be added. The kernel used to NEUTER it (letting the genuine client
 * loader's resource integration run would drag in the rest of the FancyModLoader lifecycle the kernel replaces), but
 * neutering also threw away the only well-timed handle on the repository, leaving every ecosystem asset unreachable.
 *
 * <p>The whole body is replaced with {@code KernelLifecycle.onClientResourcePacks(arg0); return;} — rewriting the
 * METHOD rather than the call site in {@code Minecraft.<init>} so any caller is covered and the
 * {@link LifecycleHookInjector}'s single-entry "required excision" gating stays untouched.
