/**
 * Points the mods button at the list that knows the whole instance.
 *
 * <p>The pause menu's mods button opens {@code net.neoforged.neoforge.client.gui.ModListScreen}, which lists
 * {@code ModList.get()} — every mod NeoForge loaded. On a NeoForge instance that is the complete answer. Here it
 * was three of sixteen, and no other family's screen does better: each reads its own loader's registry and is
 * right about it. So the button is re-pointed at {@code KernelModListScreen}, which reads {@code ModCatalog}.
 *
 * <p>BOTH families' screens are redirected, not just the one the merged button happens to call. The merged base
 * carries a lambda for each — {@code lambda$createPauseMenu$3} builds NeoForge's, {@code lambda$createPauseMenu$11}
 * builds MinecraftForge's — and which one the button is bound to is a byte-merge outcome, not a decision. Leaving
 * the loser in place would make this repair silently conditional on a merge detail that has changed before.
 *
 * <p>The rewrite is two instructions: the {@code NEW} and the {@code INVOKESPECIAL} of its {@code (Screen)}
 * constructor. Same stack shape, same descriptor, no branch and no frame — the button, its sprite, its tooltip and
 * its place in the layout are untouched, because none of them are what was wrong.
