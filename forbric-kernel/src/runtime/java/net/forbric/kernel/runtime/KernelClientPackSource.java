	 * A {@code Pack} whose metadata vanilla's {@code Pack.readPackMetadata} read, or null when it read none.

	 * <p>Called for the hooks, not for the parse: the parse is the same one NeoForge's reader does, but a guest
	 * {@code @ModifyArg} on the {@code Pack$Metadata} constructor INSIDE {@code readPackMetadata} only runs when
	 * that method does. fusion's {@code PackMixin} adds a pack's {@code fusion-overrides} folder to the overlay
	 * list there, which is how Rechiseled Anti-Blocks' connected-texture models are mounted at all.
	 *
	 * <p>What it returns is rebuilt as {@code COMPATIBLE}, keeping everything else it read — the overlays a hook
	 * added included. {@code readPackMetadata} judges compatibility against this game's pack format, and a mod
	 * jar's {@code pack_format} is routinely a version or two behind; serving mod assets forced compatible is the
	 * kernel's policy for these packs ({@code KernelClientPacks}), and the synthesised fallback does the same.
	 *
	 * <p>Null — no metadata section, or an unreadable one — sends the caller to NeoForge's reader, and from there
	 * to the synthesised metadata, exactly the path every jar took before.
	 *
	 * <p>Vanilla's reader is stricter than NeoForge's, and what it says about a pack it reads is its own, in its
	 * own log lines — the lines this jar's own loader prints for it too. A {@code pack} section vanilla's primary
	 * codec rejects (fusion-1.3.15a-forge declares a multi-version range from format 4; vanilla's floor for one is
	 * 15) gets its WARN "Error reading pack metadata, attempting fallback type" with a stack trace, and the
	 * fallback type then reads it. A section that will not parse at all ends in its outer catch, "Failed to read
	 * pack … metadata", and null — and here that jar is still served, through NeoForge's reader, which tolerates a
	 * broken {@code overlays} with a warning of its own. A namespaced section ({@code neoforge:overlays},
	 * {@code fabric:overlays}) never gets that far: {@code PackMetadataFailSoftInjector} treats one that will not
	 * parse as absent. So the residue is a Forge or Fabric mod jar with a malformed BARE {@code overlays}: its
	 * assets stay served, but the line gate-m9-client asserts absent appears, as it would on that jar's own loader.
	 * The only gate-pack jar with a bare {@code overlays} is Stellarity, which NeoForge owns. The flat fallback
	 * pass, which runs only when the parent pack cannot be built, reads each jar a second time and so repeats
	 * vanilla's lines once.
