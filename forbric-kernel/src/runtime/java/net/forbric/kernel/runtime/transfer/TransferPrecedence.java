/**
 * Which foreign provider answers a block query, decided by the ecosystem that OWNS the block entity (the mod that
 * registered its type), never by the registration order of generic fallbacks. Fabric API registers a generic
 * fallback that wraps ANY Container in a writable ContainerStorage, and it always runs before the bridge's own.
 * Asked first, it answered for NeoForge machines: their own capability and its face decisions were never
 * consulted, and simulate/abort went through the mod's Container.setItem.
 *
 * <p>Fabric mods do rely on that fallback, and vanilla containers are its purpose, so it still speaks for block
 * entities Fabric owns and for vanilla/unknown ones. For a NeoForge owner the bridge asks only Fabric's explicit
 * providers (one registered for the block, or a SidedStorageBlockEntity).
 *
 * <p>Pure: BlockTransferBridge asks {@link #answer} for every foreign query, and the transfer tests drive the same
 * function through their own Site, off-game.
