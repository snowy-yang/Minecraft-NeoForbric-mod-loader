/**
 * Gives the client's {@code ResourceManager} its selected packs BEFORE mod setup runs, so a mod that reads one of
 * its own assets from client setup finds it.
 *
 * <h2>The timing this repairs</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code Minecraft.<init>} creates an empty {@code ReloadableResourceManager} and does not fill it until
 * {@code createReload(...)}, which is the LAST thing the constructor does — after the kernel's client mod-loading
 * window. Until then {@code getResource} answers empty for everything, vanilla assets included.
 *
 * <p>NeoForge lives with that: its {@code ClientModLoader.finish()} is called from the same place, before the
 * reload, so a NeoForge mod reading a resource in client setup gets nothing there too. A Fabric mod loaded in the
 * kernel's same early window met the same empty manager and had no reason to expect it.
 *
 * <p>Xaero's World Map is what found it. Its deferred client-setup work calls
 * {@code getResourceManager().getResource(xaeroworldmap:vanilla_states.dat).get()} with no {@code isPresent}
 * check, so the empty Optional became {@code NoSuchElementException} → "Xaero's World Map has crashed!", a report
 * that names the mod and says nothing about when it ran.
 *
 * <h2>What this does, and what it deliberately does not</h2>
 *
 * <p>It installs a {@code MultiPackResourceManager} over {@code packRepository.openAllSelected()} — the same call
 * vanilla makes moments later, from the same repository, after the same {@code reload()} and
 * {@code loadSelectedResourcePacks}. It does NOT run any reload listener: nothing is baked, no model or atlas is
 * built, and vanilla's own reload still does all of that. The packs opened here are this method's own handles, so
 * vanilla closing the manager it replaces closes exactly them.
 *
 * <p>It is a LENIENCY, not a restoration of vanilla behaviour: on genuine NeoForge those reads would still find
 * nothing. Serving the resource cannot break a mod that did not ask for it.
 * {@code -Dforbric.clientResourcePreload=off} goes back to the empty manager.
