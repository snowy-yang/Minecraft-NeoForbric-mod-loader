/**
 * The game side of the kernel's mod-container factory — the one entry point the boot side calls by name.
 *
 * <p>Everything here used to be reflection on the boot side: {@code Class.forName} for six types, four
 * {@link java.lang.reflect.Proxy} instances switching on method names, and an ASM-generated {@code ModContainer}
 * subclass. None of it could be checked by a compiler, and the proxies in particular answered every method they
 * did not name with a silent null. Sixteen of the thirty-seven SPI methods involved were answered that way.
 *
 * <h2>What is still reflective, and why that is not a shortfall</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #genuineFmlContainer} still reads fields by name. That is irreducible: it allocates a
 * {@code FMLModContainer} WITHOUT running a constructor (its only one is the loader-facing 4-arg form, which
 * would run genuine FancyModLoader mod-class discovery) and then writes {@code final} fields directly. Naming a
 * final field to write it is reflection by definition. What the game side buys here is that every TYPE is
 * checked — a renamed class is now a build failure — while only the field names remain strings.
