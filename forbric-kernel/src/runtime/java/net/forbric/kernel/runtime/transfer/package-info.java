/**
 * Cross-ecosystem block-entity item/fluid/energy transfer, compiled against Fabric transfer 8.0.11, NeoForge
 * 26.2.0.88 and Team Reborn Energy 5.0.0. Every built game side carries this package: without the Fabric API or Reborn
 * compile input the build fails rather than shipping a runtime jar without it. It is never a Fabric mod, and neither
 * Fabric API nor Reborn is bundled.
 *
 * <p>Boot integration: install TransferTransactionHooks and TransferCapabilityFallback in the pre-Mixin chain
 * only when both selected APIs exist. After native capability registration, invoke BlockTransferBridge.install
 * through the GAME classloader. Installation checks every hook marker before exposing any fallback. The native
 * provider gets the first answer; a provider from another ecosystem is consulted only when that answer is absent,
 * the block entity's owner (the mod that registered its type) first. Fabric's generic fallbacks, which wrap any
 * Container, speak only for Fabric-owned and vanilla block entities (TransferPrecedence).
 * TransferIssues.setReporter can connect runtime findings to the kernel's attributed compatibility report.
 *
 * <p>The bridge pairs native transaction objects, including every outer ancestor, and closes both at the same
 * nesting boundary. Final notifications run only after both roots close, once per native participant, and may
 * open new roots and transfer again. Transfer during a close callback and joining independently-open roots are
 * unsupported. A callback throwing after commit is reported and both engines are released; external side effects
 * are not magically rolled back.
 *
 * <p>Fabric SlottedStorage is required when exposing a NeoForge ResourceHandler: an arbitrary Storage cannot
 * supply indexed insertion. Fabric has no exact resource-specific validity query; our advertised validity is
 * conservative and the real provider's insert remains authoritative. Fluid units convert exactly at 81 Fabric
 * units per millibucket, with sub-millibucket leftovers retained at their source. Failed quantization trials abort
 * before retry; amounts are never rounded after mutation. Registry identity and DataComponentPatch are preserved.
 *
 * <p>Only a loaded ServerLevel block entity on its server thread is eligible. Directions, including null, are
 * passed unchanged. Wrappers resolve providers afresh for each operation, hold world/entity references weakly,
 * and become empty after removal or unload. Capability invalidation during a transfer aborts its nested operation.
 * Recursive fallback lookup returns absent instead of wrapping itself. No level is force-loaded by this bridge.
 * Unslotted Fabric storage and entity/item capabilities remain outside scope. Hoppers are the exception: they
 * reach unslotted and block-only Fabric storages through Fabric's own lookup on NeoForge's found-nothing branches
 * (KernelFabricHopperStorage), independently of the bridge switch.
 *
 * <p>Energy (placed block entities only; item energy is not bridged) uses the same seams, endpoints, precedence,
 * invalidation and recursion guard. 1 FE = 1 E; see EnergyUnits for the int/long rule. Fabric's side is Team Reborn
 * Energy's EnergyStorage.SIDED, through RebornEnergyAdapters (PairedTransactions) and RebornEnergyBridge, the only
 * two classes that name a Reborn type and the only ones the boot seam loads when Reborn is installed.
