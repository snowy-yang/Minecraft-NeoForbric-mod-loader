/**
 * Delivers {@code RegisterKeyMappingsEvent} to the buses of mods that are not NeoForge mods.
 *
 * <p>The event's normal fan-out happens once, from {@code Options.<init>} via
 * {@code ClientHooks.onRegisterKeyMappings}, over the mods published in {@code ModList}. A Fabric mod holding the
 * NeoForge build of a multi-loader library is in neither: it gets its container from
 * {@code KernelForeignShimContext} while its own entrypoints run, which is inside {@code Minecraft.<init>} but
 * AFTER {@code Options} was built. So EntityCulling's keybind was added to a bus whose only fan-out had already
 * happened — registered, never delivered, and a keybind that is in no {@code Options.keyMappings} is a keybind the
 * player cannot see in Controls or press in game.
 *
 * <p>{@code register} writes straight into the live {@code Options.keyMappings} array, so re-posting the event here
 * puts the mappings where the game reads them. The two calls after it are what make them USABLE rather than merely
 * present: {@code Options.load(true)} is the late pass that applies a binding saved in {@code options.txt} for a key
 * that did not exist during the first load, without which the player's own rebind is silently
 * reverted to the mod's default; and {@code KeyMapping.resetMapping()} rebuilds the input→mapping index that
 * dispatch reads, without which the key is listed in Controls and does nothing when pressed.
