/**
 * Lets a model format NeoForge does not own be parsed by the code that does own it.
 *
 * <h2>Two model-format mechanisms, one deserializer</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every block model is read by {@code UnbakedModelParser.parse}, which goes through
 * {@code CuboidModel.GSON}, whose adapter for {@code UnbakedModel} is NeoForge's
 * {@code UnbakedModelParser$Deserializer}. Natively each ecosystem has its own way to plug a custom format in, and
 * both sit BEHIND that deserializer:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>NeoForge: {@code "loader": "<id>"} dispatched to a registered {@code UnbakedModelLoader}. This is the
 *       deserializer itself, and it throws {@code Unknown loader} for any id it did not register — before it ever
 *       reaches {@code context.deserialize(json, CuboidModel.class)}. Mods that add a format without registering a
 *       loader hook the vanilla {@code CuboidModel$Deserializer} instead: fusion's
 *       {@code CuboidModelDeserializerMixin} claims {@code "loader": "fusion:model"} at its HEAD.</li>
 *   <li>Fabric: {@code "fabric:type"}, dispatched through fabric-model-loading's {@code UnbakedModelDeserializer}
 *       registry by a pair of injectors on {@code ModelManager} that cannot fit this base
 *       ({@code GuestInjectorPruner} removes them). NeoForge's deserializer never looks at the key, so the model
 *       parsed as a plain empty cuboid.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>What that cost, measured on the sweep90 pack: all 220 of Traveler's Backpack's backpack models failed to
 * bake with {@code Expected BackpackDynamicModel, instead received ...CuboidModel} (its models are
 * {@code "fabric:type": "travelersbackpack:backpack"}), and Rechiseled Anti-Blocks' 24 connected-texture models
 * ({@code "loader": "fusion:model"}) would each have died on {@code Unknown loader} the moment their overlay was
 * mounted.
 *
 * <h2>The funnel</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code ModelFormatFunnelInjector} inserts one call to {@link #foreign} at the top of NeoForge's
 * deserializer, after it has checked that the element is an object and before it reads {@code "loader"}. A
 * non-null answer is returned as the model; null means "NeoForge's", and its dispatch runs exactly as before.
 * What stays unchanged, deliberately:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A {@code "loader"} id NeoForge registered is always NeoForge's. Precedence among the readers of that key
 *       is not renegotiated.</li>
 *   <li>A model naming BOTH keys — one JSON shared by a mod's builds, which {@code fabric:type} being namespaced
 *       allows — is decided by the build that is installed, because only that build registered anything.
 *       {@code fabric:type} claims it only when fabric-model-loading has a deserializer under that id; a type
 *       nobody registered, or one that does not even parse, leaves the model to its {@code "loader"}, exactly
 *       as a loader without Fabric's reader would. Without that, installing the NeoForge build
 *       of such a mod next to fabric-api failed every one of its models on Fabric's "unknown type" error. When
 *       both ids ARE registered, fabric:type wins: the registration is the mod's Fabric build saying it is the
 *       one running, whereas a NeoForge id is as likely NeoForge's own built-in, and on Fabric — the only
 *       loader that reads this key — {@code "loader"} means nothing.</li>
 *   <li>A string loader nobody claims is left to the deserializer that reads the key, in its own words.
 *       There is no "whose namespace is this" heuristic: a loader's namespace need not be its mod's.</li>
 *   <li>NeoForge's object form, {@code {"id": ..., "optional": ...}}, is NeoForge's own dialect; a non-optional
 *       miss keeps NeoForge's error.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>One NeoForge behaviour is repaired on the way through, because the funnel would otherwise inherit it: an
 * OPTIONAL object-form loader that is absent means "parse this as a plain model", and NeoForge does that by
 * falling through to the cuboid deserializer with the object still under {@code "loader"}. The plain parse gets a
 * copy without the key, so nothing downstream can mistake the loader object for model data.
 *
 * <h2>Linkage errors stay inside one model</h2>
 *
 * <p>The funnel runs guest code — a Fabric mod's deserializer, fusion's hook —
 * inside {@code ModelManager.lambda$loadBlockModels$2}, whose per-model {@code catch} covers {@code Exception}
 * and nothing else. A {@code NoSuchMethodError} or {@code NoClassDefFoundError} from code compiled against
 * another base is not an {@code Exception}: it would leave that catch, fail the whole block-model load, and a
 * failed resource reload makes Minecraft drop every resource pack, reload, and sit on a black screen. So a
 * {@code LinkageError} from anything the funnel dispatches to is rethrown as a {@code JsonParseException} naming
 * the format: that model fails, logged by the game's own "Failed to load model", and the reload goes on.
 *
 * <p>{@code -Dforbric.modelFormatFunnel=off} restores the previous behaviour on both halves: the injector is not
 * registered, and this method answers null.
