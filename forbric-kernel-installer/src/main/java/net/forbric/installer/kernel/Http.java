 * them — the release jars, Mojang's client jar, the NeoForge Maven's artifacts — funnel through the two methods
 * below. The bodies are streamed by hand rather than handed to {@code BodyHandlers.ofFile}, which writes the
 * whole response with nothing observable in between; on the multi-megabyte downloads that is several silent
