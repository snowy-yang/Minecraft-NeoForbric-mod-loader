/**
 * Produces NeoForge's patched Minecraft by driving NeoFormRuntime, the tool NeoForge itself uses.
 *
 * <p>This is the one artifact the project had no automation for at all: {@code patched-mc-neoforge-26.2.jar} was
 * a file hand-copied out of a developer's {@code ~/.neoformruntime} cache. Reimplementing what it does is not a
 * project — decompiling, patching and recompiling Minecraft <em>is</em> NeoForm — so the published tool gets
 * driven instead.
 *
 * <h2>Why the binary-patch result</h2>
 *
 * <p>NFRT's graph offers nine named results. The obvious one, {@code gameJar}, comes off the {@code recompile}
 * node: decompile with Vineflower, apply patches, recompile with an in-process {@code javac}. It works — its
 * output was verified byte-for-byte against the reference, sha1
 * {@code 5b2970209ee12702117309576b08521aa38ae67b} — but it costs a 4 GB decompiler heap, a JDK new enough to
 * compile {@code --release 25}, and a couple of minutes, and its bytes depend on a compiler version nobody here
 * controls — which, for the jar the whole game now runs on, would be a silent drift source.
 *
 * <p>{@link Pins#NFRT_RESULT} takes {@code gameJarNoRecomp} instead — {@code preProcessJar → binaryPatch →
 * copyUnpatchedClasses → applyDevTransforms}, no decompiler and no compiler. Measured: six seconds, and the same
 * 10,963 classes. The class bytes do differ from the recompile path's, in one systematic way — the binary-patched
 * classes keep Mojang's {@code MethodParameters} attribute, which {@code javac} drops without
 * {@code -parameters} — which is metadata, not semantics. What the recompile path would add on top of that is
 * bytes that depend on a compiler version nobody here controls, and this jar is now the game base itself: every
 * gate in the tree is calibrated against the binary-patch shape, not against whatever javac produced that day.
