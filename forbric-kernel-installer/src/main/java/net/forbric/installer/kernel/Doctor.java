 * Answers "would an install work here, and what would it cost?" without touching the disk.

 * <p>It exists because the expensive part of a Forbric install is not writing the profile — it is building two
 * jars the project is not allowed to hand out, which takes a JVM, a few hundred megabytes of downloads and
 * several minutes. Finding out that the machine cannot do that <em>after</em> a user has waited through most of
 * it is the failure mode worth designing away, so every precondition is resolved up front and printed.
 *
 * <p>The one invariant: this writes nothing, creates no directories, and downloads nothing. A gate asserts it.
