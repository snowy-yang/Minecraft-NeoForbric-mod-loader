/**
 * The two heavy jars a Forbric instance runs on, when someone supplies them instead of letting the installer
 * build them: NeoForge's own patched Minecraft as the game base, and the runtime assembled from NeoForge's
 * distribution.
 *
 * <p>They are not in this installer and never will be. The base is Minecraft with NeoForge's patches and the
 * runtime is assembled from NeoForge's own distribution — so both embed code this project has no right to hand
 * out. A player never needs this class: with no directory given, {@link ArtifactBuilder} builds both during the
 * install. It serves developers who already built them and want to skip that.
 *
 * <p>A missing artifact is reported by name and expected path rather than guessed at, because every later step —
 * the profile's game arguments above all — is a lie without it. A FOUND artifact is then opened and checked for
 * what only the real one carries ({@link #verifyContents}), because a file name is not an identity.

	/**
	 * Why {@code jar} cannot stand for {@code coordinate}, in words a player can act on, or null when it can.
	 *
	 * <p>The markers were chosen against the real artifacts — the ones {@link ArtifactBuilder} builds and the ones
	 * the development staging lays out — and against what a player is likely to pick up instead: NeoForge's and
	 * Fabric's installers, the vanilla client jar, NeoForge's {@code -universal} jar, and half-processed
	 * Minecraft from a build directory. Every real artifact has all of its markers; none of the others has all
	 * of them.
	 *
	 * <ul>
	 *   <li>The game base is Minecraft {@code mcVersion} (the id in its {@code version.json}, and the client's
	 *       {@code Minecraft} class) whose own classes refer to {@code net/neoforged/}: that is what carrying
	 *       NeoForge's patches looks like in bytecode. Vanilla refers to no loader, so this does not hinge on any
	 *       one class keeping one hook — in the real base hundreds of classes carry the reference.</li>
	 *   <li>The runtime holds NeoForge's core class AND its mod loader. A {@code -universal} jar has the first
	 *       without the second; the kernel needs both, and the loader half is exactly what was absent in #13
	 *       ({@code net/neoforged/neoforgespi/language/IModInfo}).</li>
	 *   <li>The runtime was built for the version this installer pins: the {@code Implementation-Version} in its
	 *       manifest's main section, which the runtime builder writes from the pin ({@link Pins#NEOFORGE}). A
	 *       runtime from an older install passes every check above: 0.2.0's NeoForge runtime,
	 *       {@code 26.2.0.38-beta}, installed without a word.</li>
