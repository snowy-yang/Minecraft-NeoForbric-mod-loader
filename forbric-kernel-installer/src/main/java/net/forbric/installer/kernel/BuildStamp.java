/**
 * Records which {@link Pins} a cached build artifact was produced from, so a pin bump cannot be served from cache.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this exists.</b> Every builder's reuse test used to be "the output file exists and is not empty", and
 * none of the artifacts carries its version in its filename — {@code neoforge-runtime.jar},
 * {@code patched-mc-neoforge-26.2.jar}. So moving the NeoForge pin from {@code 26.2.0.38-beta} to
 * {@code 26.2.0.88} and re-running the installer on a machine that had built before printed {@code
 * neoforge=26.2.0.88} in its own pin line and then {@code [neoforge-runtime] up-to-date} — and installed the OLD
 * carrier. Nothing failed; the install said "Installed." and the game came up. What it came up with was a kernel
 * built against one NeoForge and a carrier built from another, which is the silent-mismatch shape the kernel
 * spends most of its transformers defending against.
 *
 * <p>It only ever surfaced on a user's machine because the gate wipes its install directory first, so every gated
 * install was a cold one and the cache path was never exercised at a bump.
 *
 * <p><b>Every artifact is stamped with the WHOLE pin set</b>, not with the subset that feeds it. A per-artifact
 * key would also be a second place to get wrong — omit one input and the cache is silently stale again, which
 * is the bug being fixed. The cost of over-invalidating is one rebuild of a few minutes on a pin bump; the cost
 * of under-invalidating is an install that is wrong and says nothing.
 *
 * <p>A missing stamp counts as a miss: artifacts built by an installer older than this class have no stamp and
 * cannot be shown to match, so they are rebuilt once.
