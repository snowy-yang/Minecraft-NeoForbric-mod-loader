 * Turns an entrypoint definition written in another JVM language into an instance of the requested type.

 * and other mods then name it per entrypoint: {@code {"adapter": "kotlin", "value": "dev.isxander.zoomify.Zoomify"}}.
 * The adapter is itself an ordinary mod class, so it is loaded from the game loader like any other.
 *
 * <p>Part of the mod-facing ABI, reproduced from Fabric Loader (Apache-2.0, Copyright FabricMC) because a
 * third-party adapter's compiled bytecode implements exactly this interface and calls exactly this
 * {@link #getDefault()}.
 *
 * <p>NeoForbric deviation: {@link #getDefault()} resolves the sovereign kernel's own default adapter — the same
 * class/static-field/method-reference resolution the kernel applies to an entrypoint with no adapter named.
 * Adapters delegate to it for anything they do not handle themselves; {@code KotlinAdapter} does so for a plain
 * Java class.
