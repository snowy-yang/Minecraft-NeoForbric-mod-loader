 * Fabric Loader's pre-0.4 entry point, still shipped by Fabric Loader and still read by mods compiled against it.

 * <p>A CLASS, not the {@code net.fabricmc.loader.api.FabricLoader} interface: SuperMartijn642's Core Lib reads
 * {@code FabricLoader.INSTANCE.isDevelopmentEnvironment()} through {@code getstatic}/{@code invokevirtual} from its
 * mixin plugin's static initialiser. Without this class the plugin could not be built, and Mixin — which treats a
 * config whose plugin is missing as one that wants every mixin — applied the plugin's dev-only mixins in production.
 *
 * <p>Only {@link #INSTANCE} is declared: it is all mods are observed to use, and an unsupported call fails at link
 * time by name. The instance is {@link FabricLoaderImpl#INSTANCE}, which forwards to the kernel's loader.
 * {@code -Dneoforbric.fabricImpl=off} withholds this class from mods.
