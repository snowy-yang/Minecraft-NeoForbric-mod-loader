 * ({@code key -> mutable list of entries}, in invocation order), and the nested {@code NewEntry} with its
 * {@code (ModContainerImpl, LanguageAdapter, String)} constructor. SuperMartijn642's Core Lib uses exactly those to
 * append its {@code RegistryEntryPoints} to {@code main} and {@code client} — see {@code FabricLoaderImpl}.
 *
 * <p>The map is the kernel's: {@code KernelFabricLoader} fills it with one entry per entrypoint it holds, in its own
 * order, and after {@code preLaunch} takes back whatever mods did to it, in the order they left it. Nothing is
 * ordered or filtered here.
