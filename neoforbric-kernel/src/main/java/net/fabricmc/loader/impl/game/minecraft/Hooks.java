/**
 * The two calls Fabric Loader patches into the game's entry points, which mods anchor on as "Fabric has
 * initialised the mods".
 *
 * <p>Fabric's {@code EntrypointPatch} inserts {@code Hooks.startServer(runDir, null)} into
 * {@code net.minecraft.server.Main.main} and {@code Hooks.startClient(gameDirectory, this)} into
 * {@code Minecraft.<init>}; each runs the {@code main} entrypoints and then the sided ones. Neither call is in the
 * vanilla bytecode, and mods treat their presence as part of Fabric's API anyway: owo's {@code MainMixin} and
 * {@code MinecraftMixin} inject {@code @At(INVOKE, target = Hooks.startServer/startClient, shift = AFTER)} to
 * freeze its network channels, particle controllers and registry-set calls once every mod has initialised, in a
 * {@code @Group(min = 1)}. With no such call in the kernel's game, Mixin found zero matches, the group failed
 * ("expected 1 invocation(s) but 0 succeeded"), owo's freeze never ran, and the load report marked owo as only
 * partly running.
 *
 * <p>The kernel runs the entrypoints itself, so the calls are emitted at the kernel's EQUIVALENT points rather than
 * at Fabric's literal instructions ({@code LifecycleHookInjector}, {@code ClientEntrypointHookInjector}):
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #startServer} is a MARKER placed immediately after the kernel's server mod-loading window. It runs
 *       nothing — the window it follows already ran the {@code main} and {@code server} entrypoints — so an
 *       injection after it sees exactly what it sees on Fabric: every mod initialised. Placing it at Fabric's own
 *       spot (right after {@code Bootstrap.validate}) would have let owo freeze BEFORE any Fabric
 *       {@code onInitialize} ran, and a channel created there would then throw.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #startClient} is the client entrypoint hook itself, carrying Fabric's arguments: the kernel's
 *       {@code onClientEntrypoints} window runs from inside it.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Only what mods are observed to anchor on is declared (the same rule as {@code FabricLauncher}); the rest of
 * Fabric's {@code Hooks} is Fabric's own plumbing. {@code -Dneoforbric.fabricHooks=off} stops the calls being emitted.
