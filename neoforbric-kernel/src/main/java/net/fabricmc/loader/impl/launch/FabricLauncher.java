/**
 * The sliver of Fabric Loader's INTERNAL launcher that third-party mods actually call.
 *
 * <p>The kernel deliberately implements no {@code net.fabricmc.loader.impl} machinery — the Fabric ecosystem is
 * served natively, and this package is Fabric's private plumbing. But a mod that unpacks its real payload at
 * {@code preLaunch} has no public API for putting that payload on the classpath, so it reaches in here anyway:
 * CustomSkinLoader releases {@code CustomSkinLoader-Common.jar} into the game directory and adds it with
 * {@code FabricLauncherBase.getLauncher().addToClassPath(path)}. Without this it got a bare NPE from
 * {@code getLauncher()} returning null and dropped the mod's entire runtime.
 *
 * <p>Only what such mods are observed to call is declared, so an unsupported call fails at link time by name
 * instead of silently doing nothing. This surface grows on demand; it is not an attempt to reproduce the interface.
