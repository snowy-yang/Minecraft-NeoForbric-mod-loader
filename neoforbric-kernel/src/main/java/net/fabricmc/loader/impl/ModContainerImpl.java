/**
 * The type Fabric Loader's mod containers have, so a mod that casts to it succeeds.
 *
 * <p>SuperMartijn642's Core Lib looks its own container up with
 * {@code getModContainer(id).map(ModContainerImpl.class::cast)} and hands the result to
 * {@code EntrypointStorage$NewEntry}'s constructor, whose parameter is this type. Every container the kernel hands out
 * is a {@code KernelModContainer}, which extends this, so that cast holds for every mod as it does on Fabric.
 *
 * <p>Nothing of Fabric's implementation is declared here: a mod calling one of its methods fails at link time by
 * name, rather than getting an answer the kernel made up. {@code -Dneoforbric.fabricImpl=off} withholds it from mods.
