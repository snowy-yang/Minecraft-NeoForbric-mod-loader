/**
 * Turns a guest mixin's {@code @Inject(locals = CAPTURE_FAILHARD)} into {@code CAPTURE_FAILSOFT}.
 *
 * <p>A locals-capturing injector is written against ONE method body's local variable table. On the merged base
 * the body a mixin targets can carry the other family's patch — architectury's {@code MixinServerPlayerGameMode}
 * captures {@code (BlockEntity, BlockState)} from {@code destroyBlock}, and the merged method has NeoForge's
 * {@code BreakBlockEvent} local in between. FAIL_HARD makes that an {@code InjectionError}, an {@link Error} no
 * mixin error handler sees, thrown from inside the class load of the target: the popular-set server died in
 * {@code WorldLoader}. FAIL_SOFT is Mixin's own answer to exactly this: the one injection is skipped with a WARN
 * that names the mixin and the mod, and everything else the mixin does still applies. {@code -Dneoforbric.localsFailSoft=off}
 * keeps the compiled value.

	 * {@code InjectionError} from {@code postInject} — an Error, not an {@code InvalidMixinException}, so neither
	 * {@code required:false} nor any error handler sees it. Mixin wraps it as "An unexpected critical error" and
	 * abandons the TARGET class, for every mod. creativecore's {@code @Redirect(require=1)} on a
	 * {@code RegistryFriendlyByteBuf.decorator} call NeoForge widened did exactly that to
	 * {@code ServerConfigurationPacketListenerImpl}: fabric-api's configuration events could not initialise, and
	 * the main entrypoints of fabric-registry-sync, fabric-recipe-api, fabric-particles, fabric-data-attachment,
	 * puzzleslib, fzzy_config and forgeconfigapiport all threw.
	 *
	 * <p>The author's number is not lost: {@link FinalMixinApplications#remember} records it before this runs, and
	 * an injector below it in the defined class is still a CONFIRMED required finding on the mod that declared it.
	 * The mod fails; the class, and every other mod, does not. An injector that does attach produces identical code.
