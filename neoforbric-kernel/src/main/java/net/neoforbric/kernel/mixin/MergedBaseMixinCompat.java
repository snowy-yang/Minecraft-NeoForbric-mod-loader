/**
 * The guest mixins that are known not to fit the merged base, and why.
 *
 * <p>Every entry here was found empirically, by bisecting a real fabric-api 0.154.0 boot on the merged base with
 * {@code run/mixin-inventory.sh} and {@code -Dneoforbric.disableMixinConfigs}, and each is the SMALLEST unit that
 * restores a clean boot. They ship as defaults so an installed instance works out of the box; a user or the
 * inventory tool can turn them off wholesale with {@code -Dneoforbric.mergedBaseCompat=off}, and add to them with
 * {@code -Dneoforbric.suppressMixins} / {@code -Dneoforbric.disableMixinConfigs}.
 *
 * <p>This list is a debt, not a design. Each entry is a mixin whose target the vanilla+Forge+NeoForge byte-merge
 * moved, and each one costs a real feature. The mixin ADAPTER (plan M7) exists to retarget them instead, at which
 * point entries leave this list. Nothing here is suppressed to paper over a kernel bug — the boot is clean and
 * loud without them.
 *
 * <p><b>The owned-target ones are now DERIVED, not hand-listed.</b> {@link KernelGuestMixinAdapter} scans every
 * guest mixin's {@code @Mixin} target and auto-suppresses the ones that hit a class the merge rebuilt from
 * Forge/NeoForge (the whole {@code net/minecraft/client/gui/render/}, {@code .../resources/model/}, … pipeline) —
 * on a real fabric-api client that derives ~70, where this list used to name two by hand. What stays below is only
 * what the adapter CANNOT see: a mixin that applies to a vanilla-owned class and then breaks at RUNTIME, whose
 * target carries no Forge/NeoForge provenance signal.

	/**
	 * Individual mixins to drop, as {@code <config>:<MixinEntry>}. The rest of each config still applies.
	 * The registry and creative entries below are fallback pins: NeoForbricMixinService lifts them while
	 * FabricRegistryInitializationMixinAdapter, FabricRegistryLoaderMixinAdapter and
	 * FabricCreativePagerMixinAdapter retain their callbacks on the kernel's single freeze and carrier pager.
	 *
	 * <ul>
	 *   <li><b>registry-sync {@code BootstrapMixin} + {@code MainMixin}</b> — a coupled pair: the first redirects
	 *       {@code BuiltInRegistries.createContents()} to DELAY the registry freeze, the second re-runs
	 *       {@code BuiltInRegistries.bootStrap()} after mod init to perform it. Dropping only one gives
	 *       {@code IllegalStateException: Registry is already frozen}. Both are redundant here: the sovereign
	 *       kernel owns the single freeze and opens its own registration window around mod init. (Independently,
	 *       {@code BootstrapMixin.afterInitialize} could not apply anyway — its {@code @At(INVOKE,
	 *       target=Bootstrap.wrapStreams()V)} anchor does not exist, because Forge/NeoForge won the byte-merge of
	 *       {@code Bootstrap.bootStrap} and their version never calls {@code wrapStreams()}.)</li>
	 *   <li><b>registry-sync CLIENT {@code MinecraftMixin}</b> — the client twin of the same freeze-timing scheme:
	 *       it re-runs {@code BuiltInRegistries.bootStrap()} from {@code Minecraft.<init>} after the kernel already
	 *       froze, giving {@code IllegalStateException: Registry is already frozen}. Same redundancy as its three
	 *       common-config siblings above — the kernel owns the single freeze — so it is suppressed for the same
	 *       reason; without it no fabric-api CLIENT can boot. "Redundant" holds for registry CONTENTS, not for
	 *       timing: on a client the kernel's root registry is frozen from the end of the pre-{@code Minecraft}
	 *       window until {@code onClientEntrypoints} reopens it, a gap in which Fabric's is still open and no
	 *       Fabric main has run. Nothing the kernel forces may run Fabric code in that gap — its datapack-registry
	 *       declaration did, through {@code RegistryDataLoader.<clinit>}, and poisoned world loading for the
	 *       session; see {@code DatapackRegistryDeclaration}.</li>
	 *   <li><b>registry-sync {@code RegistryDataLoaderMixin}</b> — binds a {@code ScopedValue IS_SERVER} in one
	 *       wrap and reads it in another, re-binding across the async boundary in two more. The re-bind wraps do
	 *       not match the merged base's {@code RegistryDataLoader.load}, so the read throws
	 *       {@code NoSuchElementException: ScopedValue not bound} on a ForkJoin worker. Cost: registry-sync's
	 *       server/client context during datapack registry load. FabricRegistryLoaderMixinAdapter now restores
	 *       the original ScopedValue bindings and async propagation on both widened overloads; this pin returns
	 *       only with that adapter switched off.</li>
	 *   <li><b>loot-api-v3 {@code ReloadableServerRegistriesMixin}</b> — its generated callback loads a local slot
	 *       the merged base's method does not have: {@code VerifyError: Bad local variable type} at
	 *       {@code ReloadableServerRegistries.handler$…$modifyLootTable} — NeoForge swapped the last two parameters
	 *       of {@code lambda$scheduleRegistryLoad$0} and split vanilla's one element map into two, so
	 *       {@code modifyLootTable}'s {@code @Local Map} can never bind. Its sibling {@code onLootTablesLoaded}
	 *       (an {@code @Inject} at RETURN in vanilla's shape) is a different matter: {@code MixinHandlerShim} wraps
	 *       it along that lambda's row of {@code lambda-permutations.txt}, so it WOULD bind. The pin stays, and it no
	 *       longer costs the API: {@link net.neoforbric.kernel.boot.LootTableEventDispatch} fires REPLACE / MODIFY /
	 *       ALL_LOADED from NeoForge's own {@code LootTableLoadEvent} seam ({@code -Dneoforbric.lootBridge=off} to see
	 *       the old behaviour). Lifting the pin on the strength of the shim would fire ALL_LOADED twice, once from the
	 *       bridge and once from {@code onLootTablesLoaded}, and still fail on {@code modifyLootTable}.</li>
	 *   <li><b>creative-tab CLIENT {@code CreativeModeInventoryScreenMixin}</b> — Fabric's creative-screen PAGER.
	 *       The merged screen already carries NeoForge's pager as a base patch ({@code CreativeTabsScreenPage},
	 *       the "&lt; N/M &gt;" buttons), so with this mixin woven BOTH pagers run at once — and they fight:
	 *       Fabric cancels {@code extractTabButton} for any tab not on ITS OWN static {@code currentPage} (page
	 *       math over vanilla {@code CreativeModeTabs.tabs()} positions), which NeoForge's page-flip buttons never
	 *       change. Net effect: a mod tab beyond the first ten was registered, sorted, searchable, and
	 *       {@code shouldDisplay()==true}, yet drawn on NO page — Fabric hid it on NeoForge's page 2 while
	 *       NeoForge's pager kept it off page 1. One pager must own the merged screen, and only NeoForge's is part
	 *       of the base. What this mixin also carried is the implementation of {@code FabricCreativeModeInventoryScreen},
	 *       and that is NOT left out with it: fabric-api's class tweaker injects the interface into the screen
	 *       regardless, so without an implementation every call is the interface default,
	 *       {@code AssertionError("Implemented by mixin")} — owo-lib makes one each time the creative inventory
	 *       opens. {@link net.neoforbric.kernel.transform.CreativePagerBridgeInjector} implements it from NeoForge's pager
	 *       instead. FabricCreativePagerMixinAdapter keeps the original PageUp/PageDown callback and uses that
	 *       same pager, while leaving the conflicting second page state out. With the bridge
	 *       switched off, {@link #PINNED_CONTRACTS} has the mixin adapter leave out the mixins that rely on it.</li>
	 *   <li><b>Shoulder Surfing {@code CapeLayerMixin} — the only entry here that arbitrates between two MODS
	 *       rather than against the merged base.</b> Both it and CustomSkinLoader rewrite the SAME instruction:
	 *       the {@code RenderTypes.entitySolid} call inside {@code CapeLayer.submit}. Shoulder Surfing gets there
	 *       first, with an {@code @Redirect} — which does not wrap the call, it REPLACES it — and CustomSkinLoader's
	 *       cape patch is raw ASM that scans for {@code INVOKESTATIC RenderTypes.entitySolid} and finds nothing
	 *       left, reporting {@code matched protocol 776 but did not modify any bytecode}. Symptom: capes do not
	 *       render with their alpha, which is the whole point of the patch.
	 *       <p>This was originally written off as "CustomSkinLoader 15.0.1 versus MC 26.2, not ours", on the
	 *       evidence that {@code CapeLayer.submit} is byte-identical between vanilla and the merge. That
	 *       observation is true and the conclusion was wrong: the merge is innocent, but the conflict is real and
	 *       it is ours to arbitrate, because we are the loader that put these two mods in one game.
	 *       <p>Cost of this entry, measured rather than assumed: Shoulder Surfing's handler returns
	 *       {@code entityTranslucentCullItemTarget} only when its {@code isPlayerTransparencyEnabled()} option is
	 *       on, and plain {@code entitySolid} otherwise — so with that option at its default the mixin changes
	 *       nothing at all while still consuming the call site. Suppressed, CustomSkinLoader's patch lands
	 *       ({@code Transformed …CapeLayer with [customskinloader:render-patch]}, zero patch failures) and what
	 *       is lost is one Shoulder Surfing option's effect on the cape specifically. Reverse it with
	 *       {@code -Dneoforbric.keepMixins=shouldersurfing.common.mixins.json:CapeLayerMixin}, which restores the
	 *       transparency option and re-breaks capes — the trade is genuinely two-sided, so it is left switchable
	 *       rather than decided in code alone.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 *
	 * <p>{@code fabric-resource-loader-v1}'s {@code PackRepositoryMixin} USED to be suppressed here — it made the
	 * vanilla datapack stop contributing (13 empty dynamic registries, "Missing data pack fabric-convention-tags-v2"),
	 * the server half of the Fabric gap. It is no longer suppressed: the actual fault was PackMixin's
	 * {@code parentsPredicate} field initializer being MIS-WOVEN by Mixin into NeoForge's recursive {@code Pack}
	 * constructor loop (so top-level packs kept a null predicate and every one read as hidden), and
	 * {@link PostMixinFixups} repairs that at the source. Now the whole module runs on both sides.
	 *
	 * <p>{@code fabric-rendering-v1}'s {@code GuiRendererMixin} + {@code GameRendererMixin} USED to be hand-listed
	 * here and are the reason {@link KernelGuestMixinAdapter} exists — the archetypal owned-target case (NeoForge won
	 * {@code GuiRenderer.<init>}, re-typed its {@code List} param, orphaned the {@code pictureInPictureRenderers}
	 * field the mixin {@code @Shadow}s; erasure hides it so the inject applies then reads null → NPE). Both are gone
	 * from this list: {@link MixinFit}'s orphaned-{@code @Shadow} check names that hazard directly, and
	 * {@link PostMixinFixups#seedOrphanedPipRenderers} repairs it at the source so the mixin can simply be KEPT.
	 *
	 * <p><b>{@code fabric-model-loading-api-v1}'s {@code ModelManagerMixin} is the measured case for dropping a
 * PARTIAL — and is now TRIMMED rather than pinned.</b> The merged (NeoForge-patched) {@code ModelManager} no longer
 * reads model JSON through {@code CuboidModel.fromStream} in {@code lambda$loadBlockModels$2}, so the mixin's
 * {@code @Redirect} there cannot bind while its sibling {@code @ModifyArg} at {@code Pair.of} does — textbook
 * half-application: every model json is handed to Fabric's deserializer with the stream already consumed, all 4666
 * block models die on {@code JsonParseException: JSON data was null or empty}, and the world builds correctly out of
 * the missing-model cube — every block the magenta/black {@code missingno} checkerboard while the GUI, fonts and
 * item icons stay perfect. No crash, no error the renderer can attribute. Pinned whole, block models load but every
 * Fabric {@code ModelLoadingPlugin} is registered and never called. {@link
 * net.neoforbric.kernel.transform.GuestInjectorPruner} now removes exactly those two injectors from the mixin's bytes
 * before Mixin reads them, so the other eight apply as written; the pin moves to {@link #SUPPRESSED_UNLESS_PRUNED}
 * and returns only under {@code -Dneoforbric.guestInjectorPruner=off}. This is precisely why PARTIAL defaults to KEEP
 * but is logged with its missing anchors: strict mode drops 107 mixins including Sodium's core render path, whereas
 * the log points at the one that actually matters. Pin measured PARTIALs here, one at a time — and trim them when
 * the unfit injectors are separable.

	 * that interface: suppressing it does not merely drop a feature, it makes the cast throw.
	 *
	 * <ul>
	 *   <li><b>Jade {@code GuiGraphicsExtractorMixin}</b> — {@code implements JadeGuiGraphics} on the owned
	 *       {@code GuiGraphicsExtractor}. Suppressed, Jade's {@code OverlayRenderer} threw
	 *       {@code ClassCastException: GuiGraphicsExtractor cannot be cast to JadeGuiGraphics} on every frame it drew
	 *       its overlay — which aborted {@code Minecraft.renderFrame} at {@code extract}, BEFORE {@code render} and
	 *       {@code GpuSurface.present}, so the frame was never drawn OR presented. Symptom: Jade shows nothing when
	 *       you look at a block, and from that moment the display freezes on the last good frame, so the game looks
	 *       like it stopped responding to keys (input polling is fine — {@code Minecraft.run} calls
	 *       {@code RenderSystem.pollEvents} BEFORE {@code runTick}, so the throw never blocks it). Safe to keep: the
	 *       merged {@code GuiGraphicsExtractor} still has the {@code minecraft} field it {@code @Shadow}s and the
	 *       {@code containsPointInScissor} method it injects into.</li>
	 *   <li><b>Jade {@code FogRendererMixin}</b> — kept for a different reason: not a duck interface, just a
	 *       measurement that came out the other way. The adapter auto-suppresses it because NeoForge won the merge
	 *       of {@code FogRenderer.setupFog} ("forge hook lost" in the conflict report), and it had been pinned in
	 *       {@link #SUPPRESSED_MIXINS} as UNDIAGNOSED. Diagnosed now: the mixin is four instructions that copy

	 *       reader guards on BOTH being 0 and returns early — so suppressing it cost exactly one thing, Jade's
	 *       overlay no longer being distance-culled against fog, and cost it silently because Jade degrades by
	 *       design. Kept it and measured: it applies with no partial-anchor warning and gate-m9 is green on all 41
	 *       assertions. Note this entry only takes effect on the client; a dedicated server never loads
	 *       {@code FogRenderer} at all, so the server gates cannot see it either way — which is why the pin it
	 *       replaced was about freezing the SERVER surface and this one is not.</li>
	 *   <li><b>resource-loader {@code SynchronizeRegistriesTaskMixin}</b> — the other former pin, and the one that
	 *       was actually about the server. It and Jade's fog mixin were the ONLY two the adapter auto-suppresses
	 *       server-side (the other 163 are client-only), so naming them in {@link #SUPPRESSED_MIXINS} froze the
	 *       server surface against the derived rule. Nothing was ever wrong with this mixin: every shadow and
	 *       anchor resolves, and it applies cleanly — it is 3 small injectors that let the server reuse the
	 *       CLIENT's reported known-pack set when its own {@code requestedPacks} is a superset, instead of
	 *       vanilla's stricter comparison. Measured with the pin lifted: gate-m2b 20/20, gate-m4 30/30, gate-m9
	 *       39/39, and the three numbers the pin named — "Loaded 1585 recipes", {@code forge: 10}, {@code
	 *       neoforge: 35} — all unmoved. Restored, because a half-disabled fabric-api module is worse than a
	 *       measured one.
	 *       <p><b>What that measurement does NOT cover, and the next person should not read into it:</b> every
	 *       gate here negotiates over a MEMORY connection (singleplayer's integrated server) or boots a dedicated
	 *       server nobody connects to. A real remote client and server with DIFFERENT pack sets — the case this
	 *       mixin exists for — is still unexercised. Green here means "no regression in what is tested", not

	 * with {@code NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "java.util.Map.size()" because "m" is null} at

	 * archetype the adapter was built to prevent. fabric-api's renderer mixins contribute interfaces AND carry
	 * behaviour that the merge broke, so "contributes an interface" cannot separate them from Jade's. A sound general
	 * rule would have to prove the mixin's {@code @Shadow}n fields are still ASSIGNED in the merged target; until
