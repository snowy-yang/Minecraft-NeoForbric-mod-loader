/**
 * Mixins that were written to attach to ANOTHER MOD and did not.
 *
 * <p>This is the failure no dependency check can see. Iris declares {@code sodium 0.9.x} and Sodium
 * 0.9.2-beta.1 is inside that range, so every loader — NeoForbric and stock Fabric alike, measured against Fabric's
 * own {@code VersionPredicate} — says the requirement is met. What is not met is the binary shape: Iris's
 * {@code @Redirect} wanted a call to {@code RenderRegion.clearAllCachedBatches()} inside
 * {@code RenderRegionManager.uploadResults}, and that Sodium no longer makes it. The declaration is right and
 * the bytecode is wrong, and only the bytecode was ever checked.
 *
 * <p>Recorded here so the boot can put it in front of the player next to the unmet dependencies, which is the
 * same question from their side: two mods are installed and they do not fit.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this is worth being loud about when a half-applied mixin is not.</b> Measured across every gate log
 * in this repo: 1226 anchors that do not resolve, all of them on merged-base classes, all on runs that pass —
 * and not one on another mod's class. The signal separates cleanly because the merged base is a rewritten game
 * and mixins miss it constantly, while two mods either fit or do not.
