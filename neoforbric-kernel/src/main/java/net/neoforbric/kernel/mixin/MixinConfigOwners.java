/**
 * Which mod a mixin config came from, so that a failure can say.
 *
 * <p>Both producers know the answer and both used to throw it away. The Forge-family side builds a record that
 * carries the jar, and the Fabric side is iterating mod containers when it collects the declarations — but both
 * were flattened to a bare list of config names before anything downstream saw them. Everything after that
 * point, including Mixin's own messages, could only name a file.
 *
 * <p>A player reading "sodium-common.mixins.json failed" has to already know which jar that is. On a
 * tri-ecosystem instance, where the same mod may be present as a Fabric build and a NeoForge build and only one
 * of them won arbitration, that is not a reasonable thing to expect them to know.
 *
 * <h2>Ambiguity is answered with silence, never with a guess</h2>
 *
 * <p>Two shapes produce a config more than one mod can claim. A MinecraftForge toml with several
 * {@code [[mods]]} sections copies one config list into every mod it declares, so a first-wins rule would pick
 * one id and be quietly wrong about the others. And {@code Mixins.registerConfiguration} de-duplicates by config
 * NAME, so two different jars shipping the same name register once and the loser is invisible.
 *
 * <p>In both cases this class answers null and callers fall back to the bare config name. A confidently wrong
 * mod name is worse than no mod name: it sends someone to the wrong jar, and it makes the log look more
 * authoritative than it is. The same id appearing twice is not ambiguity and keeps its owner.
