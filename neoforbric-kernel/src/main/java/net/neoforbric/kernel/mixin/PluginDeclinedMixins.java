/**
 * Keeps a suppression off the mod's row when the mod's own mixin config plugin did not want that mixin either.
 *
 * <p>A config plugin ({@code IMixinConfigPlugin}) is how a mod says "apply this mixin only when …". The common
 * case is a compatibility mixin gated on another mod being installed — {@code mixinconstraints}'
 * {@code @IfModLoaded}, which Flashback uses for its Bobby, Sodium and Iris compat classes. On Fabric the plugin
 * is asked first and answers {@code false}, so the mixin is never prepared and nothing is lost.
 *
 * <p>Here the order is inverted, for a reason worth keeping: {@link KernelGuestMixinAdapter} rewrites the config
 * JSON to remove a mixin it has judged {@code UNFIT} <em>before</em> Mixin reads it, because a mixin that fails
 * to APPLY costs its target class every other mod's mixins too. So the plugin is never asked about the entry
 * that was removed, and the mod got marked DEGRADED for losing a mixin it had itself switched off. Flashback's
 * {@code compat.bobby.MixinIntegratedServer} is the worked example: {@code @IfModLoaded("bobby")}, bobby not
 * installed, every anchor resolving against Bobby's classes and therefore none of them resolving here — UNFIT
 * for exactly the reason the mod already knew about.
 *
 * <p>What this class changes is the REPORT, never what applies. The suppression still happens, at the same
 * moment, for the same reason. The attribution is held back and settled later, by asking the plugin the same
 * question Mixin would have: {@code shouldApplyMixin(target, mixin)}, once per target as Mixin asks it. Only a
 * clear {@code false} for every target clears the mod.
 * No plugin instance, a plugin that throws (the guard turns that into {@code true}), anything other than
 * {@code false} — all attribute exactly as before. Guessing in the mod's favour is how a report starts lying.
 *
 * <p>The instance is the one Mixin built, captured by {@link GuestMixinPluginGuard} when it wraps {@code onLoad}.
 * Constructing a second one would be a side effect nobody asked for, and would answer for a plugin that had not
 * been initialised.
 *
 * <p>{@code -Dneoforbric.pluginDeclinedMixins=off} attributes everything, which is how the claim in each skipped
 * line can be checked against the Mods screen.
