/**
 * The one place the class pipeline asks which Mixin transformer to weave with — so a guest that REPLACES that
 * transformer, the way it does on NeoForge, is honoured.
 *
 * <h2>Why a slot at all</h2>
 *
 * <p>On NeoForge the live weaver sits in a field: {@code FMLMixinClassProcessor.transformer}, which the processor
 * reads again for every class it handles. LibJF's ASM layer depends on exactly that — its mixin plugin walks
 * {@code TransformingClassLoader} to that field, wraps what it finds in its own {@code AsmTransformer}, and writes
 * the wrapper back, so every class after that goes through Mixin and then LibJF's patches. The kernel captured its
 * transformer once, in a local the define lambda closed over, so there was nothing a guest could replace: even with
 * the rest of that object graph in place, the wrapper would have been written into a field nobody reads.
 *
 * <p>The graph itself is {@code KernelFmlTransformerView}, game-side, which hands the guest a
 * {@code TransformingClassLoader} whose processor holds {@link #original()} and registers a reader of that field
 * here with {@link #watch}. From then on {@link #currentOr} answers with whatever the field holds, so a wrapper —
 * or a wrapper of a wrapper — is what weaves.
 *
 * <h2>What it costs everyone else</h2>
 *
 * <p>Nothing that shows: until a view is handed out there is no reader, and {@link #currentOr} is one volatile read
 * that returns the transformer it was given. {@code MixinEnvironment.setActiveTransformer}, which LibJF also calls,
 * is deliberately NOT a way in: it does not reroute weaving on NeoForge either.
 *
 * <p>{@code -Dneoforbric.fmlTransformerView=off} hands out no view, so the guest fails its cast exactly as before.
