/**
 * Points a guest mixin at the anonymous class the byte merge moved its target's body into.
 *
 * <p>javac numbers anonymous classes per outer class in source order, so a carrier patch that adds one before
 * vanilla's renumbers every later one. The merge keeps one class per name, and the loser's body moves: on this
 * base {@code ByteBufCodecs$30} is a carrier's codec, and vanilla's — the one every mod was compiled against —
 * is at {@code $32}. {@link MergedBaseAnonymousDrift} is the measured table of where each body went.
 *
 * <p>{@link MixinFit} already reports this, which is how it was found: Polymer's {@code ByteBufCodecsHolderMixin}
 * and {@code ByteBufCodecsRegistryMixin} were auto-suppressed as UNFIT with the reason naming the new home. But
 * reporting is all it did, and the cost of those two mixins going missing is not a missing feature — Polymer then
 * sent {@code polymer:hello} with a codec nothing could encode, and the client was disconnected at world join
 * with {@code HelloS2CPayload cannot be cast to DiscardedPayload}. A stack that names Netty, vanilla's codec and
 * the mod, and nothing about an anonymous class that changed number.
 *
 * <p>Replaced, not appended — the difference from {@link MixinMergedTwin}. A renamed TWIN is still vanilla's class
 * under another name, so a mixin that meant it keeps it. A renumbered name is a DIFFERENT class that merely
 * inherited the number, and leaving the mixin on it is the bug: every anchor resolves and the injections bind to
 * unrelated code.
 *
 * <p>Only when the table names exactly ONE candidate and it exists here. Several candidates — the same body
 * duplicated across numbers — and it declines, because the mixin would then be moved somewhere by a coin flip,
 * and a wrong home is worse than the honest UNFIT report this replaces.
 *
 * <p>{@code -Dneoforbric.mixinAnonymousDrift=off} leaves every target as compiled.
