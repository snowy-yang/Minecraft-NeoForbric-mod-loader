/**
 * What each ecosystem registered a payload type for, against what actually got declared to the peer.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is the family with no instrument</h2>
 *
 * <p>Five gates exist for networking and every one of them was red when it was written, with the worst symptoms
 * this project has: cannot connect, kicked one second after joining, a block decoded as a different block. On
 * one connection three handshake protocols are live, each treats the first {@code minecraft:register} it sees as
 * the peer's complete declaration, and each can veto the connection on its own.
 *
 * <p>The specific failure this counts is the one that kicked a player out of a world a second after joining: a
 * mod registers a payload type, nothing declares that channel to the peer, and the peer answers an unhandled
 * packet by disconnecting. Both halves are knowable at the moment they happen and neither was written down, so
 * the difference between them — a payload type with no channel declaration — was invisible until a mod used it.
 *
 * <p>Registration and declaration are recorded separately and joined at report time, because the whole point is
 * the difference. Everything here is best-effort and never throws: a census that can break a connection is worse
 * than no census.
 *
 * <p><b>Where it can answer.</b> The registered half is recorded on both sides — a client registers payload
 * types too — but the declaration half and the report hang off the connection's own declaration path, which is
 * NeoForbric's only when the SERVER is NeoForbric. Measured: gate-m12, whose server is NeoForbric, produces the line;
 * gate-m14, whose server is native Fabric, produces none on either side. So the gates whose server is Paper or
 * native Fabric have nothing here to assert, and saying that is better than adding an assertion that would pass
 * on an absence.
