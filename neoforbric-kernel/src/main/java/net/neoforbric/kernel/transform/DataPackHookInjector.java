/**
 * Gives the kernel the server datapack {@code PackRepository}, by prepending one call to the head of
 * {@code ResourcePackLoader.populatePackRepository(PackRepository, PackType, boolean)}.
 *
 * <p>That method is the genuine loader's own choke point for mod packs and it SURVIVED the byte merge — the merged
 * base's {@code ServerPacksSource.createPackRepository} still calls it, which is how a mod's
 * {@code AddPackFindersEvent} handler runs today. What does not survive is its payload: the mod packs come from
 * {@code ModList.get().getModFiles()}, which the kernel leaves empty, so the call adds nothing. Hooking here rather
 * than at {@code ServerPacksSource} keeps the kernel's packs in exactly the position NeoForge puts its own —
 * before {@code AddPackFindersEvent}, so a mod's explicitly-registered builtin pack still lands on top of its own
 * root data.
 *
 * <p>PREPENDS, never replaces: the rest of the method is the {@code AddPackFindersEvent} post, and Tectonic's
 * builtin datapack is registered from it. Replacing the body the way {@link ClientPackHookInjector} does would take
 * that away.
 *
 * <p>Frame-safe by construction: two {@code ALOAD}s and a static call at the head, no new locals and no branch, so
 * every existing stack-map frame still describes the same state. {@code COMPUTE_MAXS} because {@code max_stack}
 * may need to reach 2.
