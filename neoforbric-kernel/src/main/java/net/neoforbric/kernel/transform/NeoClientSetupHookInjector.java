/**
 * Fires the NeoForge client setup lifecycle from inside {@code Minecraft.<init>}, immediately AFTER
 * {@code this.options} is assigned.
 *
 * <p>The two ecosystems want windows that cannot be the same one, which is why this exists alongside
 * {@link ClientEntrypointHookInjector} rather than sharing its anchor:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Fabric's client entrypoints must run while {@code options} is still NULL — keymapping registration rejects
 *       a built {@code Options} with "GameOptions has already been initialised". That hook anchors on the
 *       {@code new Options} itself.</li>
 *   <li>NeoForge's {@code FMLClientSetupEvent} must run once {@code options} EXISTS. Genuine NeoForge runs its
 *       client mod loading later in the same constructor, and mods rely on it: JourneyMap's setup loads its config,
 *       which validates against {@code Minecraft.getInstance().options.renderDistance()} and NPE'd on the null,
 *       leaving every JourneyMap property null and killing the render loop the moment the world drew.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>So the order inside one constructor is: singleton assigned → Fabric client entrypoints → {@code Options}
 * built → NeoForge client setup. Both ecosystems get the state they were written against.
 *
 * <p><b>The anchor is NeoForge's own call site</b>: the {@code ClientModLoader.finish()} invocation the merged base
 * already carries in {@code Minecraft.<init>}. That is precisely where genuine NeoForge completes client mod
 * loading, so anchoring there inherits its timing instead of guessing at it — and the kernel already neuters
 * {@code finish()}'s body (it would re-drive the discovery the kernel owns), so the call site is otherwise inert.
 *
 * <p>Guessing was tried and does not converge: anchoring just after {@code PUTFIELD Minecraft.options} cleared
 * JourneyMap's {@code options.renderDistance()} NPE only to hit {@code font.isBidirectional()} on the next field,
 * assigned a few hundred instructions later. Every such field is another round; {@code finish()} is after all of
 * them by construction.
 *
 * <p>A no-arg void {@code INVOKESTATIC} inserted before it is stack-neutral (no operands, no branch), so it needs
 * no frame or max-stack change.
