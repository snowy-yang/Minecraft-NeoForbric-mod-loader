/**
 * What a {@link ClassTransformer} promises to edit, so that its failing to edit it can be noticed.
 *
 * <p>Most transformers in this package find an anchor in a target class's bytecode and splice there. When a
 * carrier moves or renames that anchor, about a third of them simply {@code return classBytes} and say nothing,
 * and {@link TransformChain} has never asked whether any of them fired. That combination is how a NeoForge
 * carrier bump from 26.2.0.38-beta to .88 took four separate repairs offline at once, each costing a
 * user-visible feature, with nothing in the log naming any of them.
 *
 * <p>A declaration here is deliberately only <em>which classes</em> this transformer must land on — never a
 * method name, a descriptor or an instruction shape. The hit signal is the one {@link ClassTransformer#transform}
 * already contracts for: the same array back means "I made no edit". So the audit and the transformer cannot
 * drift apart, because the audit does not re-implement the match; it watches the transformer make it.
 *
 * <p>The class names are declared, not searched for in a particular jar. {@code ModListScreen} migrated out of
 * the merged base and into the NeoForge carrier between two carrier versions; pinning which artifact a class
 * ought to live in would be one more thing to keep current. "It is in none of them" is a finding, not a lookup
 * failure.

	 * {@code ClientPackHookInjector}'s class javadoc and {@code LifecycleHookInjector}'s note on MinecraftForge's
	 * no-arg {@code ServerModLoader.load}. Encoding that is what keeps the audit from crying wolf on the entries
