/**
 * Gives {@link KernelClientSmoke} a tick to run on, so an unattended client run can end by itself.
 *
 * <p>Registered unconditionally but inert unless {@code -Dneoforbric.clientSmoke=true}: a gate harness must not be
 * able to change what a normal launch executes, and the cheapest guarantee of that is emitting no bytecode at all.
 *
 * <p>A COREMOD transform rather than a kernel-owned mixin. The kernel already transforms {@code Minecraft} for the
 * client-setup window, so this needs no new machinery — no mixin config to register, no ordering against guest
 * mixins to reason about, and nothing that shows up in the mixin config list a gate asserts on.
 *
 * <p>Injected at the HEAD of {@code tick()V}, which is exactly once per tick with no frame to author: the method
 * has several returns and hooking each one would call the controller more than once on some paths. The
 * controller reads a tick behind as a result, which for counting ticks spent in a world is not a distinction.
