 * The fixed, ordered stages of NeoForbric's single unified class-transformation pipeline.

 * <p>NeoForbric hosts <em>one</em> transforming class loader. Both ecosystems' bytecode edits are
 * expressed as {@link ClassTransformer}s slotted into these phases, which always run in
 * {@linkplain #ordinal() declaration order}. This replaces Fabric's hardcoded
 * {@code entrypoint -> FabricTransformer -> Mixin} sequence and Forge's separately-owned
 * {@code IClassTransformer}/{@code ILaunchPluginService} chain with a single ordering all mods share.
 *
 * <p>{@link #MIXIN} is terminal and exclusive: it is applied last by the class delegate (which owns
 * the single {@code IMixinTransformer}), so no transformer may register into it via the
 * {@link TransformChain}.
