/**
 * Gives {@code ServerChunkCache$MainThreadExecutor} an {@code execute} that refuses work once its own
 * thread is dead.
 *
 * <p><b>Hardening, not a repair.</b> Nothing here is broken by the merge or by NeoForbric: the merged
 * {@code ServerChunkCache} and Lithium's {@code getChunkOffThread} were both measured byte-for-byte
 * equivalent to vanilla. This exists because one class of MOD bug — keeping a {@code ServerLevel} from an
 * integrated server that has already stopped — cashes out as three permanently parked threads and a
 * 15-second watchdog kill whose crash report names nobody. See {@code KernelChunkExecutorGuard} for the
 * measured incident.
 *
 * <h2>Why the executor and not {@code getChunk}</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code ServerChunkCache.getChunk} is the obvious place and the wrong one: Lithium {@code @Overwrite}s
 * it, so a guard there is deleted on any install that has Lithium — which is most of them, and was this
 * one. Both the merged base's own off-thread branch and Lithium's replacement reach the executor through
 * {@code this.mainThreadProcessor}, so guarding the executor covers both and cannot be overwritten out
 * from under itself.
 *
 * <h2>Why a synthesized override rather than an edit</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code MainThreadExecutor} does not declare {@code execute} at all — it inherits
 * {@code BlockableEventLoop.execute}. Editing the base class would put this guard in front of EVERY event
 * loop in the game (the client's, the server's main loop, the IO worker's), which is a far larger
 * behavioural change than the one being made. Adding the override to the subclass keeps it to exactly the
 * executor that the incident named.
 *
 * <h2>Frames</h2>
 *
 * <p>The synthesized body is straight-line: load {@code this}, ask it for its running thread, hand that
 * to the guard, then {@code super.execute}. The branch lives in the guard, in Java, precisely so that no
 * jump is authored here and no {@code StackMapTable} entry has to be. That is why the guard takes a
 * {@code Thread} and decides for itself rather than returning a boolean this method would have to test.
