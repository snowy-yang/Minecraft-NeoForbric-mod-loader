/**
 * Lets a FABRIC mod's Sodium options page exist, on an instance whose Sodium is the NeoForge build.
 *
 * <p>Sodium's video-settings screen is built from its config users, and its NeoForge build discovers them two
 * ways, both NeoForge-only: {@code ConfigLoaderForge.collectConfigEntryPoints} walks {@code ModList.getMods()}
 * reading {@code sodium:config_api_user} out of each {@code IModInfo.getModProperties()} (bci 68-118), then
 * walks {@code ModList.getAllScanData()} for {@code @ConfigEntryPointForge} (bci 130-306). A Fabric mod
 * declares the same thing as a Fabric ENTRYPOINT, has no {@code IModInfo}, and is not in {@code ModList} at
 * all — so neither walk can reach it, and there is no warning anywhere, because nothing looked.
 *
 * <p>Neither loader can produce that pairing: it exists because this one arbitrated two builds of sodium and
 * kept the NeoForge one, while the mods that integrate with it are Fabric. On the reporting instance that was
 * voxy — an entire page missing from Video Settings on a boot that reported every mod loaded.
 *
 * <p>The edit is one instruction: {@code INVOKESTATIC KernelLifecycle.onSodiumConfigUsers()V} immediately
 * before the method's {@code RETURN} (offset 309 on sodium 0.9.2). It takes nothing and returns nothing, so it
 * consumes and produces no stack, introduces no branch target, and shifts no existing frame — which is why
 * this transformer AUTHORS no {@code FrameNode}, unlike every splice in {@link CommonNetworkInteropInjector}.
 * It must still PRESERVE the frames already there, and getting the reader flags wrong for that cost a boot
 * crash; see {@link #transform}.
 *
 * <p>Placed at the END on purpose. Sodium's own two walks run first and register everything it can see by
 * itself, so the kernel's pass can skip a mod that is already in {@code ModList} rather than racing it — and
 * the deadline that matters is {@code registerConfigsLate}, which is later still.
