/**
 * Lets a Fabric mod register a key mapping BEFORE {@code Minecraft} exists, instead of dying on a null instance.
 *
 * <p>fabric-api's {@code KeyMappingRegistryImpl.registerKeyMapping} opens with
 * {@code if (Minecraft.getInstance().options != null) throw new IllegalStateException("GameOptions has already
 * been initialised")} and then appends to a static list that {@code Options}' constructor drains through
 * {@code process(KeyMapping[])}. The check exists to reject registration that is TOO LATE. It reads
 * {@code getInstance().options} to decide that, and so it also throws — with a {@code NullPointerException}
 * naming neither the mod nor the timing — when registration is too EARLY, which is the one case that is
 * provably harmless: the list is static, {@code Options} has not been built yet, and {@code process} will pick
 * the mapping up when it is.
 *
 * <p>On Fabric nobody reaches the early case, because nothing calls into a mod before {@code Minecraft.<init>}.
 * Here they do, and the path is not the entrypoints — the kernel already moved those into {@code Minecraft.<init>}
 * for exactly this reason ({@code ClientEntrypointHookInjector}). It is a guest MIXIN on a merged-base seam that
 * runs earlier than its Fabric equivalent and drags the mod's {@code <clinit>} along with it:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Flashback's {@code MixinMappedRegistry} is {@code @Inject(method = "freeze", at = @At("HEAD"))} with the
 *       body {@code if (!this.frozen && Flashback.isInReplay())} — {@code !frozen} meaning "this is the real
 *       freeze". Its {@code invokestatic Flashback.isInReplay} initialises {@code Flashback}, whose
 *       {@code <clinit>} registers four key mappings.</li>
 *   <li>On Fabric the first {@code MappedRegistry.freeze()} happens inside {@code Minecraft.<init>} after the mod
 *       initializers, because {@code fabric-registry-sync-v0} moves it there ({@code BuiltInRegistriesMixin}
 *       cancels the {@code Bootstrap} freeze, {@code MainMixin} / client {@code MinecraftMixin} re-run it later).
 *       Measured on a stock Fabric 26.2 client: {@code Flashback} initialises at 11.48s, the freeze at 12.15s.</li>
 *   <li>Here those three mixins are suppressed on purpose — the kernel owns the single freeze and opens its own
 *       registration window around mod init ({@link net.neoforbric.kernel.mixin.MergedBaseMixinCompat}) — and that
 *       window is at {@code ClientModLoader.begin()}, i.e. still inside {@code Main.main}, BEFORE
 *       {@code new Minecraft(...)}. So the freeze the guest mixin is waiting for arrives while
 *       {@code Minecraft.getInstance()} is still null, and the client dies in {@code Bootstrap} with a stack
 *       that names {@code MappedRegistry}, {@code Flashback} and fabric-api, and nothing about timing.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Moving the kernel's freeze is not the fix: NeoForge's lifecycle puts mod registration at
 * {@code ClientModLoader.begin()} and that is before {@code Minecraft} by construction. What is wrong is not
 * WHEN the freeze happens but that a legal-but-early call into this API is a crash instead of a no-op. So the
 * edit is to the API's own guard: two instructions at the head of {@code registerKeyMapping} that skip the check
 * when there is no {@code Minecraft} yet, reusing the branch target the existing {@code IFNULL} already has —
 * no new label, no new frame, no change to the late-registration rejection it was written for.
 *
 * <p>{@code -Dneoforbric.earlyKeyMapping=off} restores the unguarded read.
