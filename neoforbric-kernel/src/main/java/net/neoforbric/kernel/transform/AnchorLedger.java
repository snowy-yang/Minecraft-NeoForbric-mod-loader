/**
 * Keeps the books on {@link AnchorSet} declarations: for each declared anchor, was the class ever handed to the
 * transformer, and did the transformer ever change it.
 *
 * <h2>Two findings, and only one of them is unambiguous</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link Miss} — the class WAS loaded and the transformer declined it — is a defect every time. Nothing is
 * being guessed at: the bytes went past and the repair did not apply. It is reported the moment it happens,
 * at ERROR, once, and needs no end-of-boot checkpoint to be trustworthy.
 *
 * <p>{@link Absent} — the class was never loaded — means nothing on its own. A client-only target on a dedicated
 * server is absent and correct; a {@code HEDGE} anchor is absent and correct by design. It is collected for the
 * summary and never raised on its own. Keeping the two in separate fields is the whole of the "do not cry wolf"
 * design; there is no switch layered on top to quiet it down.
 *
 * <h2>Why booleans and not counters</h2>
 *
 * <p>The chain runs over each class twice — once for Mixin's pre-weave view of it and once when it is defined
 * (see {@code NeoForbricClassLoader}) — and whether the first of those happens at all depends on whether any mixin
 * config targets the class. A count would therefore differ between two correct runs. "Seen" and "edited" do not.
