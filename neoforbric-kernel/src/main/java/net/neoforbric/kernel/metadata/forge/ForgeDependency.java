/**
 * One {@code [[dependencies.<modId>]]} entry from a Forge {@code mods.toml}.
 *
 * <p>This is the raw, clean-room representation: the Maven {@link #getVersionRange() version range} exactly as
 * the file wrote it. {@code ForgeMetadataMapper} translates it into a {@link UnifiedDependency}, whose predicate
 * dialect is the one NeoForbric evaluates.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #getOrdering() ordering} and {@link #getSideScope() side} axes are the unified enums rather than
 * Forge-specific copies. They were Forge-specific once, which meant two identical three-valued enums with two
 * identical parsers — and a mapper that could only cross the gap by dropping them, which is exactly what it did.
