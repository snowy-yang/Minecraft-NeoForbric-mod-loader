/**
 * What {@code mods.toml}'s {@code modLoader} field says a mod is written in, and what this kernel does about it.
 *
 * <h2>Why this file exists at all</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code modLoader} has been parsed, stored and exposed since the metadata layer was written, and read by
 * nothing. The only place the string {@code lowcodefml} appeared in this project was a test fixture. So a mod
 * that is not written in Java was loaded as though it were: the Forge-family path reflects the widest public
 * constructor, finds none on a Kotlin {@code object}, and reports "no public constructor" — a true sentence
 * about a mod that is not broken, with the actual reason sitting unread in its own manifest.
 *
 * <p>The Fabric side has never had this gap. {@code KernelLanguageAdapters} exists precisely because, without
 * it, every Kotlin mod died on "language adapter 'kotlin' is not supported yet" — a message that at least named
 * the problem. This is the Forge-family half of that, starting with naming it.
 *
 * <h2>What is and is not handled</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code javafml} — a Java {@code @Mod} class, constructed by reflection. The default and the normal case.</li>
 *   <li>{@code kotlinforforge} — on genuine Forge the provider reads the Kotlin {@code object}'s
 *       {@code INSTANCE} field instead of calling a constructor. The kernel now does the same when a mod class
 *       has no public constructor, so the common shape works; anything the provider does BEYOND that does not.</li>
 *   <li>{@code lowcodefml} — a manifest-only mod with no mod class at all. Nothing to construct, and nothing
 *       here goes wrong; it is named so that "this pack contains one" is a fact in the log rather than a
 *       surprise later.</li>
 *   <li>anything else — unknown, and said so by name.</li>
 * </ul>
