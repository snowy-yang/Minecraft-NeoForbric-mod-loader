/**
 * What version of each ecosystem this instance actually provides, and whether the mods believe it is enough.
 *
 * <p>WHY THIS EXISTS. A genuine NeoForge refuses to launch when a mod's {@code versionRange} on {@code neoforge}
 * is not satisfied, and says so by name. The kernel parses those ranges — {@code ForgeMetadataMapper} translates
 * every one of them into a Fabric predicate — and then nothing ever evaluates them, so an under-provisioned mod
 * loads and fails later, somewhere else, in a shape that names neither the mod nor the version.
 *
 * <p>Measured cost of not having this: JEI 30.14.0.87 declares {@code neoforge [26.2.0.16-beta,)} and the carrier
 * was {@code 26.2.0.7-beta}. It loaded. Nine releases of drift later, {@code NeoForgeGuiPlugin} died on
 * {@code NoClassDefFoundError: net/neoforged/neoforge/common/extensions/TooltipFlagExtension} — an interface that
 * genuinely does not exist in .7, where those methods are inlined on {@code TooltipFlag} instead. Tracing that
 * back to a version range took a disassembler. One warning line would have said it.
 *
 * <p>That warning is also what the carrier bump was decided on: the NeoForge carrier moved to
 * {@code 26.2.0.38-beta}, which does ship {@code TooltipFlagExtension}, and is now {@code 26.2.0.88} — the first
 * release line rather than a beta. This audit reports nothing for the merged pack at either. Two things follow. Silence here is now the assertion (gate-m9-client pins the set to empty), and
 * this class has done its job precisely when it has nothing to say — so resist deleting it as unused. And the
 * example above is history, not the current state; do not read the version out of it.
 *
 * <p>It WARNS rather than rejects, deliberately. Rejecting is what a genuine loader does and would be the more
 * faithful choice, but it is also a decision to eject mods from a running pack, and that belongs to whoever
 * assembled the pack — not to a diagnostic. The warning names the mod, the requirement and the reality; acting on
 * it is a separate call.
