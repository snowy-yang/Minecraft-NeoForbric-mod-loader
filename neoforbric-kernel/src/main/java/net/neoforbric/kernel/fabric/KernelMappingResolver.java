/**
 * The kernel's {@link MappingResolver}.
 *
 * <p>The sovereign kernel runs the merged base in the <b>named</b> (Mojmap) namespace, and modern Fabric mods
 * for this game version ship already compiled against Mojmap too — a constant-pool scan of fabric-api 0.154.0
 * and Jade 26.2.9 finds zero {@code class_}/{@code method_}/{@code field_} intermediary symbols. So no runtime
 * remapping happens and every lookup is the identity.
 *
 * <p>This is deliberately not a stub: mods query the resolver precisely so they need not assume, and returning
 * the input for a query in the runtime namespace is the correct answer, not a fallback. A query naming a
 * namespace the kernel does not carry (e.g. {@code intermediary}) also returns the input — the honest reply
 * when no mapping data is loaded, and the same thing Fabric Loader does for an unmapped member.
