/**
 * The classes from Fabric Loader's INTERNAL packages the kernel ships, and the switch that takes them away again.
 *
 * <p>The kernel implements no Fabric Loader machinery. But mods link against a handful of its internals anyway, and on
 * Fabric those links hold: Core Lib's {@code preLaunch} (and every SuperMartijn642 mod's content with it) goes through
 * {@code FabricLoaderImpl}'s entrypoint storage, its mixin plugin reads the legacy
 * {@code net.fabricmc.loader.FabricLoader}, pets-mod calls {@code StringUtil.capitalize}, and owo anchors on
 * {@code Hooks.startServer}. Each is shipped as the narrowest surface those mods use, by exact name, so anything beyond
 * it still fails by name.
 *
 * <p><b>Pinned to the parent, by exact name.</b> There must be one copy, the kernel's: a mod that shaded Fabric
 * Loader's real {@code FabricLoaderImpl} would otherwise win child-first and run Fabric's own static initialiser in
 * the middle of the kernel's boot. Only the names listed are pinned; the rest of {@code net.fabricmc.loader.impl}
 * keeps today's child-first rule, so a mod's shaded copy of some OTHER internal helper keeps working as before.
 *
 * <p><b>Withheld by {@code -Dneoforbric.fabricImpl=off}.</b> The class loader then answers
 * {@code ClassNotFoundException} for every name in {@link #SWITCHED}, and the kernel stops reading the entrypoint
 * storage back — exactly the behaviour from before these classes existed. {@code Hooks} is not in that set: the game's
 * own entry points call it, and it has its own switch ({@code -Dneoforbric.fabricHooks=off}) that stops the calls
 * being emitted in the first place.
