/**
 * Looks for ASCII needles in raw class bytes, without parsing or copying them.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists as a shared thing</h2>
 *
 * <p>Several transformers run for EVERY class the game loads and want the same cheap first question: does this
 * class even mention the name I care about? A class file stores type and method names in its constant pool as
 * modified UTF-8, and every name these transformers look for is plain ASCII, so it appears in the bytes
 * verbatim. A "no" is therefore final, not a guess — the class provably does not name it.
 *
 * <p>Three copies of this had grown, each slightly different, and one of them turned the whole class into a
 * {@code String} first: an allocation the size of the class, for every class, to ask a question that needs none.
