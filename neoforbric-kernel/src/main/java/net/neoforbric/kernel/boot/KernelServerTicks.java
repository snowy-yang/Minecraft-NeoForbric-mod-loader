/**
 * How long this server's ticks actually take.
 *
 * <h2>Why a loader needs to know</h2>
 *
 * <p>There is no tick-time, frame-time, TPS or memory measurement anywhere in this tree. A mod whose entire
 * value is a number — Sodium, Lithium, FerriteCore — proves nothing here by loading, and when a player says
 * this loader is slow, nothing in the project can agree or disagree. Meanwhile the architecture is additive by
 * construction: every event may go to three buses, there are dozens of bridges, dozens of bytecode repairs, a
 * frame recomputer and a pile of pre-staged resource packs.
 *
 * <p>Vanilla's own "Can't keep up!" is a threshold crossing and says nothing until it is crossed. This is the
 * distribution underneath it, so a bug report carries the number instead of an adjective.
 *
 * <h2>What it measures, exactly</h2>
 *
 * <p>The interval between consecutive tick STARTS, which is what a tick rate is. Hooking entry only, rather than
 * entry and every exit, is deliberate: the method has several returns, and the template this follows
 * ({@code ClientSmokeTickInjector}) records the same reasoning. The first interval after a pause — a server with
 * nobody on it stops ticking — is discarded rather than counted as a slow tick.
 *
 * <p><b>The interval includes the sleep, so the MEAN is not the signal.</b> A server that is keeping up holds
 * 50ms exactly, by sleeping off whatever the tick did not use; the first live run read "mean 50.00ms" and, with
 * the threshold at the budget itself, called 48% of ticks late — which was measuring jitter around the target
 * and nothing else. The tail is the signal: an interval at twice the budget means the server could not sleep,
 * and a healthy run has none.
 *
 * <p>On by default, because a measurement nobody switches on is a measurement nobody has;
 * {@code -Dneoforbric.tickSampler=off} turns it off, and it costs one {@code nanoTime} and a few adds per tick.
