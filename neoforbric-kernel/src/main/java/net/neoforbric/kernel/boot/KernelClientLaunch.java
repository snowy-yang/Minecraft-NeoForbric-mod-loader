 * <p>The launch script must add the client-only JVM setup the merged base's rendering stack needs — on macOS
 * {@code -XstartOnFirstThread} (GLFW must own the main thread) and {@code -Djava.library.path} pointing at the
 * LWJGL natives. Everything after {@code --} is forwarded to {@code net.minecraft.client.main.Main} (which, unlike
 * the dedicated server, accepts {@code --gameDir} / {@code --assetsDir} / {@code --assetIndex} / account args).
