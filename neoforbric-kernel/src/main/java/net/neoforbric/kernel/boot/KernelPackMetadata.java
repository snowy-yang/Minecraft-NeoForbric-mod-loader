/**
 * Decides whether a {@code pack.mcmeta} section that will not parse is fatal to the WHOLE pack.
 *
 * <p>On a normal instance exactly one loader is running, so a pack only ever meets the metadata parsers that
 * loader ships. On NeoForbric all three are running at once, and a multiloader mod's {@code pack.mcmeta} carries a
 * section per loader — so a Fabric-only build gets read by NeoForge's parser, which then resolves things only a
 * NeoForge build would have registered.
 *
 * <p>Observed on two real mods. {@code lithostitched} and {@code Terralith} are Fabric-only builds whose
 * {@code pack.mcmeta} ships BOTH a {@code fabric:overlays} and a {@code neoforge:overlays} section (one source
 * tree, one metadata file, every platform's section in it). The NeoForge section names its overlay conditions by
 * type — {@code "type": "lithostitched:breaks_seed_parity"} — and NeoForge's parser resolves those against the
 * {@code neoforge:condition_codecs} registry. The Fabric build never registers there; its condition class
 * {@code implements net.fabricmc.fabric.api.resource.conditions.v1.ResourceCondition} and lands in Fabric's
 * registry instead. So the lookup misses and the codec throws.
 *
 * <p>The damage is out of all proportion to the cause. {@code ResourceMetadata}'s JSON-backed {@code getSection}
 * hard-throws through {@code DataResult.getOrThrow}, and {@code Pack.readPackMetadata} wraps its whole body in
 * {@code catch (Exception) -> LOGGER.warn("Failed to read pack {} metadata") -> return null}, which
 * {@code readMetaAndCreate} turns into "no pack". **One unparseable optional section silently deletes the entire
 * pack.** Both mods vanished from the ResourceManager; lithostitched's {@code template_list} data never loaded;
 * {@code TemplateLists.getRandom} called {@code Optional.get()} on the resulting empty registry; and ruined-portal
 * chunk generation died with a {@code ReportedException} about twelve seconds after the player joined. The user
 * reported it as the game freezing, because that is what a crash looks like from inside the twelve seconds.
 *
 * <p>The rule here restores what the pack was actually built and tested against: <b>a section this instance
 * cannot parse is treated as ABSENT, exactly as a loader with no parser for it would treat it.</b> Skipping
 * {@code neoforge:overlays} on a Fabric mod is not a compromise — it is precisely what stock Fabric does, and the
 * mod ships {@code fabric:overlays} alongside it for that reason.
 *
 * <p>The test is whether the section name contains a colon, NOT whether its namespace is {@code minecraft}.
 * Vanilla's own sections are not namespaced at all — they are the bare names {@code pack}, {@code overlays} and
 * {@code features} — so a namespace check would have failed open on the very sections that must stay loud. A
 * colon means some loader or mod defined the section, and only those fail soft; corruption in {@code pack} still
 * throws, and the original exception propagates unwrapped so the crash report is unchanged.
 *
 * <p>Escape hatches via {@code -Dneoforbric.packMetadataFailSoft}: {@code off} restores vanilla's
 * everything-throws behaviour, {@code all} extends fail-soft to vanilla-named sections too. {@code all} exists
 * for one known residual — a pack whose BARE {@code overlays} section carries {@code neoforge:conditions} would
 * still be dropped by the default rule, because {@code overlays} is a name vanilla owns. No pack in the observed
 * mod sets does that, and widening the default pre-emptively is how the over-broad generalisations documented in
 * {@code MixinFit.Result#shouldSuppress} got their start.
