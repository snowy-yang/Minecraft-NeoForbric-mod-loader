/**
 * Who else stops working when one mod does.
 *
 * <h2>Why the report needs this</h2>
 *
 * <p>The load report names the mod that failed. When that mod is a LIBRARY, the player is not looking at the
 * library — they are looking at the dozen mods that quietly stopped doing anything, none of which is named
 * anywhere. The names in this project's own history are mostly libraries: supermartijn642corelib, architectury,
 * Puzzles Lib, balm, glitchcore, TerraBlender. {@code gate-m24-brokenmod} asserts that one mod's failure does not
 * spread, and its canary has no dependants, so the assertion has never been asked the question a pack asks.
 *
 * <p>This does not decide that a dependant failed — it cannot, and claiming so would be the false-accusation
 * shape this tree has already had to delete once. It states the fact the reader needs and cannot get anywhere
 * else: these mods declared they REQUIRE the one that did not load.
