/**
 * Which mods' deferred setup tasks threw, read off a carrier's own {@code DeferredWorkQueue} after
 * {@code runTasks}.
 *
 * <p>Both families' queues have the same private shape — a {@code tasks} deque of {@code TaskInfo}, each with an
 * {@code owner} container and a {@code future} — and {@code runTasks} leaves the deque as it was, with a failed
 * task's future completed exceptionally. So the owners are read from there. The obvious alternative, reading
 * the mod id off the suppressed throwables {@code runTasks} throws, is not possible: both carriers wrap the raw
 * failure and put the mod id only in their log line, never on the exception.
 *
 * <p>Any reflective failure — a renamed field, a container without {@code getModId} — answers an empty list and
 * one DEBUG line, so the callers' count-only report is the worst case; the staged carriers' field names are
 * pinned by a test so a carrier bump goes red there rather than losing attribution silently.
