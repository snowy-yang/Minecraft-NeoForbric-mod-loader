/**
 * The classes that exist only in the build of a duplicated mod the kernel did not load.
 *
 * <p>When one mod id is claimed by two jars — a Fabric build and a NeoForge build of the same mod — exactly one
 * is loaded, and {@link DuplicateModArbiter} already measures what that costs: sodium's losing FABRIC build
 * carries 727 classes the winning NEOFORGE build does not. Until now that measurement was a log line and
 * nothing else read it.
 *
 * <p>It needs a reader, because those 727 classes are a hole only this instance has. Iris ships
 * {@code mixins.iris.fabric.json:MixinFluidRendererImpl}, {@code @Mixin(sodium.fabric.render.FluidRendererImpl)},
 * whose whole job is to implant the {@code VertexEncoderInterface} that Iris then casts the fluid renderer to.
 * With sodium's NeoForge build loaded that target does not exist, so the mixin is inert — silently, because a
 * mixin whose target never loads is not an error anywhere. The player turned shaders on two minutes after a
 * boot that reported every mod loaded, and got
 * {@code ClassCastException: sodium.neoforge.render.FluidRendererImpl cannot be cast to VertexEncoderInterface}
 * on the first chunk of water.
 *
 * <p>Neither loader can produce that pairing — it exists because this one put a Fabric mod and a NeoForge mod in
 * the same game and then chose between two builds of what they both depend on. So naming it is the kernel's job,
 * and the remedy is the kernel's own lever: pick the other build in {@code neoforbric-mods.txt}, or install the
 * dependent's build from the same family.

	 *
	 * <p>It was OFF while the measurement behind it was inexact, and the two rounds it took are worth keeping,
	 * because both errors pointed the same way — over-reporting — and both would have put a wrong line on the
	 * Mods screen:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>the class sets were compared TOP-LEVEL ONLY, so a build that nests its shared half looked like it was
	 *     missing hundreds of classes the other build plainly had (sodium's NeoForge build bundles the common
	 *     {@code sodium.client.*} in {@code META-INF/jars/}); fixed by recursing into bundled jars;</li>
	 * <li>"only the losing build has it" was read as "nothing in this instance has it". A losing build routinely
	 *     bundles a THIRD mod's classes — sodium's Fabric build ships fabric-api's
	 *     {@code ExtendedBlockModelSubmit}, which the player's own fabric-api supplies regardless; fixed by
	 *     subtracting every class the jars that did load provide, in
	 *     {@code DuplicateModArbiter.classesStillLoaded}.</li>
	 * <li>and the same mistake once more with a different supplier: a losing build that shades a LIBRARY the
	 *     game's own {@code libraries/} serves anyway. glitchcore's Fabric build carries all 189
	 *     {@code com.electronwill.nightconfig.core.*} classes, and after the first two fixes those 189 were still
	 *     the entire recorded set for that mod; fixed by {@code DuplicateModArbiter.onTheLaunchClasspath}.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * Each round was found by reading what the live 28-mod instance actually recorded rather than by reasoning
	 * about it, and each time the residue looked plausible until it was read. The counts on that instance went
	 * 4 mods marked → 2 → 1 (sodium, 481 loser-only classes narrowed to 19) → 0, which is correct for it today:
	 * the one true finding this was written for, iris' {@code MixinFluidRendererImpl} against sodium's
	 * Fabric-only {@code FluidRendererImpl}, went away when iris' NeoForge build replaced its Fabric build. The
	 * true-positive path is held by {@code KernelGuestMixinAdapterTest} instead.
