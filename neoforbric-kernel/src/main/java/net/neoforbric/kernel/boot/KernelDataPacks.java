/**
 * Serves a Forge-family mod jar's own {@code data/} — its recipes, tags, loot tables, advancements and datapack
 * registry content — to the SERVER datapack {@code PackRepository}.
 *
 * <p>Why this has to exist at all. A genuine loader turns every mod jar into a pack: NeoForge's
 * {@code ResourcePackLoader.findResourcePacks()} walks {@code ModList.get().getModFiles()} and builds one
 * {@code Pack} per mod file, for both {@code PackType}s. The kernel publishes its mods into {@code ModList} through
 * {@code setLoadedMods}, which fills {@code mods}/{@code sortedContainers}/{@code indexedMods} but deliberately
 * leaves {@code modFiles} EMPTY — so that walk finds nothing and not one Forge-family mod's data is ever read.
 * Fabric mods are unaffected: fabric-api's own resource loader serves them from Fabric's mod list, which is why the
 * gap stayed invisible for so long — every gate that checked datapack content happened to use Fabric builds.
 *
 * <p>What it actually costs, measured. lithostitched ships the same {@code data/} tree in its Fabric and its
 * NeoForge build — byte-identical listings. Booted at the same seed with the same fabric-api, the FABRIC build
 * reaches {@code Done}; the NEOFORGE build dies generating the first ruined portal, because lithostitched's own
 * mixin redirects vanilla's template selection into {@code TemplateLists.getRandom}, which does
 * {@code registry.get(RUINED_PORTAL_STANDARD).get()} on a {@code lithostitched:template_list} registry that exists
 * (the kernel declares it correctly) and is EMPTY (nothing ever read the JSON that fills it). Same mod, same data,
 * same seed — only the manifest differs. That is the shape of this bug: not a crash in the loader, a silent absence
 * that surfaces as the mod's own code failing somewhere unrelated.
 *
 * <p>Metadata is read through NeoForge's own {@code ResourcePackLoader.readWithOptionalMeta} rather than
 * synthesised, which is the difference from {@link KernelClientPacks}: that path invents a forced-COMPATIBLE
 * {@code Pack$Metadata} and never opens the jar's {@code pack.mcmeta}, which is fine for assets but would throw away
 * a mod's root-pack {@code overlays} — the very sections {@code PackOverlayMutabilityInjector} exists to keep
 * working. {@code readWithOptionalMeta} reads the real metadata with an unlimited supported-format range and
 * tolerates a jar with no {@code pack.mcmeta} at all, which is exactly the genuine loader's behaviour.
 *
 * <p>The two runtime carriers ({@code neoforge-runtime.jar}, {@code forge-runtime-interop.jar}) are served the
 * same way, and they are not an afterthought: the merged base carries only {@code data/minecraft/*}, so without
 * them the whole {@code c:} convention-tag skeleton — 513 tag files, the thing every cross-mod recipe is written
 * against — simply does not exist, and neither does {@code neoforge:damage_type} or either loader's data maps.
 *
 * <p>Ordering between the two was the part that needed an answer, and the measurement gave one. Of the 746 data
 * files both carriers ship, 640 are byte-identical; the 106 that differ are 57 tags, 30 loot tables and 19 recipes.
 * Tags are additive — not one carrier tag file sets {@code "replace": true} — so for those, serving both IS the
 * answer and the union is what a genuine tri-loader instance would have. The other 49 are last-wins, and NeoForge
 * takes them: the merged base IS NeoForge with MinecraftForge spliced in, and NeoForge's versions are written
 * against its own registered ingredient types ({@code neoforge:difference} and friends), which resolve here.
 *
 * <p>What this does NOT do is add recipes. Every one of the carriers' 208 and 394 recipe files overrides a vanilla
 * recipe id — none is new — so the {@code Loaded 1585 recipes} count three gates use as their canary does not move.
 * What changes is those recipes' CONTENT: NeoForge rewrites vanilla's ingredients to be tag-based (a bundle takes
 * {@code #c:leathers} rather than {@code minecraft:leather}), which is precisely what lets a mod's own leather work
 * in a vanilla recipe. Getting 1585 and getting the right 1585 are different claims; this one is about the second.
