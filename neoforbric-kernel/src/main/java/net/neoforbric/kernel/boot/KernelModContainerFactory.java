/**
 * The boot-side door to the kernel's mod-container factory, which lives on the GAME side.
 *
 * <p>Manufacturing a {@code ModContainer} means naming {@code net.neoforged.fml.ModContainer},
 * {@code neoforgespi.language.IModInfo}/{@code IModFileInfo}/{@code IConfigurable},
 * {@code neoforgespi.locating.IModFile} and {@code bus.api.IEventBus} — game types, which boot-side code cannot
 * name. So it was done here with {@code Class.forName} for each of them, four {@link java.lang.reflect.Proxy}
 * instances switching on method NAMES, and an ASM-emitted {@code ModContainer} subclass: 373 lines in which
 * nothing was checked by a compiler.
 *
 * <p>The proxies were the expensive part. Each answered the methods it named and sent every other one to a
 * {@code defaultReturn} — null for objects, false for booleans, empty for collections. Across the four SPI
 * interfaces that is 37 methods, of which 21 were named; the remaining 16 answered "nothing" with no record
 * anywhere that they had. A method renamed in a future NeoForge would have joined them silently.
 *
 * <p>All of it now lives in {@code net.neoforbric.kernel.runtime.KernelContainers}, compiled against the staged
 * jars, where javac enumerates every one of those 38 methods and refuses to build until each is answered
 * deliberately. What remains here is the door: one class lookup, two methods, cached.
