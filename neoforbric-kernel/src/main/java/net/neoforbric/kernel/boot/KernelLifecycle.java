		// is loaded". This ran CLIENT-ONLY, on the reasoning that it left the proven server path alone; what it
		// actually left alone was a dedicated server with NO STARTUP or COMMON config loaded at all. A mod that
		// keys anything off its own config then has nothing to read: Balm sets a mod's active config from its
		// ModConfigEvent.Loading listener, so with the event never fired Waystones' getActive() —
		// Objects.requireNonNull(...) — threw NPE out of setupDynamicRegistries and the server died before Done.
		// Only the CLIENT type is client-only; NeoForge loads STARTUP and COMMON on both sides, and SERVER is

		loadEarlyConfigs(cl, side);
		// Step 2c2: wire NeoForge's OWN @EventBusSubscriber classes from its runtime jar. NeoForge ships as a mod and
		// FML scans its jar like any other; the kernel scanned only mod jars, so ~10 internal subscribers (network,
		// attachments, configuration tasks, model data, …) never fired. Must precede step 2d — the network setup posts

		// Step 3a: let mods declare their DATAPACK registries. These are not the registries RegisterEvent fills —
		// they are the per-world ones RegistryDataLoader builds from datapacks, and NeoForge collects them through
		// DataPackRegistryEvent.NewRegistry into DataPackRegistriesHooks. Nothing posted that event, so the list

		// before any world is created; here is the first point where every mod's listeners are registered.
		//
		// Not here on a client whose Fabric mains run in Minecraft.<init>, though. This step initialises
		// RegistryDataLoader, whose initialiser runs Fabric mod code (WorldWeaver's datapack entrypoints ride a TAIL
		// injector there), and on native Fabric that code first runs at world load, after every main. Left here it
		// ran before any of them, with minecraft:root frozen: wover-biome's codec registry, which its own main
		// creates, was created from the initialiser instead, threw "Registry is already frozen", and poisoned
		// RegistryDataLoader and DataPackRegistriesHooks for the session — no world could be created, loaded or
		// joined, and NeoForge's data maps died with them. It moved when the client mains did (09d86de) and this
		// step did not. It runs at the end of onClientEntrypoints instead: after every main and client entrypoint,
		// the root frozen again, which is the state the dedicated server already declares in, cleanly.

		// Step 3a2: open the game event buses — HERE, not after the setup lifecycle.

		// Genuine NeoForge starts NeoForge.EVENT_BUS at the end of CommonModLoader.begin, immediately after its
		// "Config loading" task and before load() posts common setup (javap: getstatic NeoForge.EVENT_BUS;
		// invokeinterface IEventBus.start right after the second runInitTask). The kernel started it last, after
		// every setup phase — and IEventBus.post on a bus that has not started RETURNS SILENTLY (`getfield
		// shutdown; ifeq; return`). So a mod that posts its own API event during FMLConstructModEvent, RegisterEvent
		// or common setup — the "register with me" shape addon mods are built on — posted into nothing: no
		// listener ran, no error, no log, and the posting mod carried on with an empty result.
		//
		// Everything the kernel wires onto these buses (the Neo→Forge bridges inside startGameBuses, NeoForge's own
		// @EventBusSubscriber classes in step 2c2, the client reload bridge in 2c3) is already registered by this
		// point, and adding a listener to a started bus is allowed anyway.
		startGameBuses(cl, side);
		// Step 3b: post the FML setup lifecycle at every NeoForge mod. Genuine NeoForge produces these inside
		// CommonModLoader.load(), whose only client caller is ClientModLoader.finish() — which the kernel neuters
		// because it also drives the discovery/registration the kernel owns. Nothing replaced the setup phases, so
		// they never fired for anyone: AppleSkin registers its food tooltip from FMLClientSetupEvent
		// (preInitClient -> TooltipOverlayHandler.init -> NeoForge.EVENT_BUS.register), which is why the tooltip
		// stayed missing even after mod-bus delivery was fixed.
		fireModSetupLifecycle(cl, side);

		// construction's own events, so a mod that registers a config from FMLConstructModEvent or common setup —
		// and a Fabric mod registering one through the ForgeConfigAPIPort — has a config that is registered and
		// never loaded. Reading it then throws "Cannot get config value before config is loaded" rather than
		// returning a default, from wherever the mod first asked. This opens only what has no loaded config yet, so
		// it cannot re-open what step 2c already did; on a pack where nothing registers late it says nothing.

		// ClientNetworkRegistry.setup() then posts the client-handler event and validates every to-client payload has
		// one — else the join negotiation rejects with "Incompatible client! (No Handler for …)".
		//
		// This used to run as step 2d, BEFORE the setup lifecycle, and that ordering was wrong: setup() flips
		// NetworkRegistry's `setup` flag, after which any registration throws "Cannot register payload <id> after
		// registration phase". Mods register payloads from FMLCommonSetupEvent — CreativeCore does, for itself and
		// for EnhancedVisuals — so on the Odyssey pack their payloads never registered and the player was dropped
		// with "Network Protocol Error" seconds after the world rendered. Genuine NeoForge closes the phase after
		// mod loading, which is what this now matches. On the CLIENT it moves later still, to onClientEntrypoints,
