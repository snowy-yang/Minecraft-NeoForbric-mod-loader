/**
 * The answer {@code Registries.registryDirPath} gives for a registry, decided by the ecosystem that owns it.
 *
 * <p>Vanilla's body is the registry's path and nothing else, so a mod registry {@code wover:wover/world_preset_info}
 * would read {@code data/<ns>/wover/world_preset_info/}. All three loaders put the registry's namespace in front of
 * that — but in different places. NeoForge and MinecraftForge patched the BODY ({@code CommonHooks.prefixNamespace},
 * or the same test inline). Fabric left the body vanilla and adds the namespace afterwards: fabric-registry-sync's
 * {@code RegistriesMixin} is a {@code @ModifyReturnValue} on {@code elementsDirPath} and {@code tagsDirPath}. For
 * a plain mod the three agree on {@code data/<ns>/<registry ns>/<registry path>/}.
 *
 * <p>They stop agreeing the moment another mixin stands between the body and Fabric's modifier, and WorldWeaver
 * (wover) does exactly that. Its {@code RegistryDataLoaderMixinEarly}, at priority 200, injects at the RETURN of
 * {@code elementsDirPath}, cancellable, and for each of its own six datapack registries hands back the value the
 * body returned. Being applied first, its early return comes before fabric's modifier and skips it, so on native
 * Fabric those registries read the vanilla directory — which is where wover ships them:
 * {@code data/wover/wover/world_preset_info/normal.json} is element {@code wover:normal} of
 * {@code wover:wover/world_preset_info}, and {@code data/minecraft/wover/worldgen/biome_data/} holds the ten
 * vanilla Nether and End biomes' placement data.
 *
 * <p>The merged base took NeoForge's body. The value wover handed back was therefore already prefixed,
 * {@code wover/wover/world_preset_info} — {@code data/<ns>/wover/wover/world_preset_info/}, a directory nothing
 * ships — and the two of its registries that have data loaded EMPTY without a word: the sweep pack's content
 * census counted 5+3 preset entries and 10 biome entries on native Fabric and none here. Wover's world types lost
 * their settings, its Nether and End generators lost where each vanilla biome belongs, and both fell back to
 * defaults in silence. Its tags were never affected: its mixin leaves {@code tagsDirPath} to fabric's modifier.
 *
 * <p>So the body answers as the owner's loader would: vanilla's path for a registry whose namespace belongs to a
 * Fabric mod, whatever the merged body said for everything else. Nothing changes for a plain Fabric registry,
 * because fabric's modifier still runs after this and puts the namespace back exactly as it does natively — the
 * only registries whose directory moves are those a mod intercepted the way wover does, and they move to where
 * that mod put its data. {@code componentsDirPath} (datagen only) follows too; Fabric never prefixed it. That
 * leans on fabric-registry-sync's {@code RegistriesMixin} applying here as it does natively, so {@code Registries}
 * is asked first whether it took it ({@link #fabricPrefixes}): where it did not, every registry keeps the merged
 * answer.
 *
 * <p>Ownership is the namespace's: {@link ModPresence#soleEcosystem}. A namespace no mod claims — or that mods of
 * two ecosystems claim — keeps the merged answer, which is what every registry had before this existed. Called from
 * game code on resource-reload threads, so it never throws: a failed decision is the merged answer.

	 * out vanilla's path without it would move every Fabric registry's elements and tags to an unprefixed

	 * really took — after the adapter, the pins and arbitration, in the class the game runs. It is complete on the

	 * an application to the MIXIN's {@code ClassInfo}, never the target's, so {@code Mixins.getMixinsForClass} on
	 * {@code Registries} is empty however many it took, and the mixin's entry sits in a plain map the transformer
	 * writes from other class-loading threads. {@code -Dneoforbric.registryDirectoryOwner=force} skips the question.
