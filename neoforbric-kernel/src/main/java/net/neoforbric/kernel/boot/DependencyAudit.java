/**
 * Says out loud whether each mod's declared hard dependencies are actually met, ACROSS ecosystems.
 *
 * <p>Nothing did. {@code EcosystemVersions.audit} checks the platform ids a mod declares — {@code minecraft},
 * {@code neoforge}, {@code forge} — and a single-ecosystem loader's own resolver would check the rest, but under
 * NeoForbric no resolver runs over the combined set: the Fabric side solves only Fabric mods, and the Forge families'
 * mods are driven by {@link KernelLifecycle} rather than by FML's resolution. A Forge mod requiring a mod that is
 * not installed therefore reached its constructor and failed there, as a {@code NoClassDefFoundError} or a null
 * dereference somewhere inside the mod, with nothing anywhere saying "you did not install its dependency".
 *
 * <p>The reason this belongs to NeoForbric rather than to either ecosystem is the other half: on a merged instance a
 * Forge mod's requirement can be satisfied by a FABRIC mod, and vice versa. Neither loader can see that, so
 * neither can report it — one would call it missing and the other would never be asked. This counts those too,
 * because "your Forge mod's dependency is provided by the Fabric mod next to it" is the single most NeoForbric-shaped
 * fact the boot log can carry.
 *
 * <h2>It reports; it never refuses</h2>
 *
 * <p>Deliberately no enforcement. Refusing to boot over an unmet requirement is what a genuine loader does, and it
 * is the wrong trade here: a single bad declaration would cost the user every other mod, and NeoForbric's whole value
 * is "load as much as possible and be honest about the rest". {@link net.neoforbric.api.VersionPredicate} fails open
 * for the same reason — an unreadable constraint is not evidence of a problem.
