/**
 * The order mods are constructed and initialised in.
 *
 * <h2>What it replaces</h2>
 *
 * <p>Jar file name, alphabetically. That is what discovery hands out and what every downstream pass kept: mods
 * were constructed in it, Fabric mods were registered and their entry points invoked in it. It is not an order,
 * it is an accident of what the files are called — so a mod whose jar sorts before a library it needs ran first
 * and called that library's API before the library had initialised. What comes back is an error inside the
 * library, attributed to the library, on a line that has nothing to do with the real cause.
 *
 * <h2>What the real loaders do</h2>
 *
 * <p>NeoForge's and MinecraftForge's {@code ModSorter} sort topologically, but the only edges a mod's own metadata
 * draws there come from the explicit {@code ordering} key ({@code BEFORE}/{@code AFTER}). A requirement with no
 * ordering draws none. Ties go to mod-file order. This class goes further than both: a mod also comes after
 * everything it requires, so it cannot run before a library it needs.
 *
 * <p>Fabric Loader does not sort by dependency at all. 0.19.5's {@code ModResolver.findCompatibleSet} returns the
 * resolved set sorted by mod id, and mods, entrypoints and mixin configs all follow that list. Dependencies only
 * decide which mods are selected. Fabric mods are written against that order, and at least one set of them depends
 * on it (see {@link FabricLoadOrder}), so this class no longer orders Fabric mods' initialisation. It still orders
 * Fabric mods in two places. It decides which of two same-id Fabric jars is registered, and it gives the
 * Forge-family seeders the Fabric mods in this order. Under {@code -Dneoforbric.fabricOrder=off}, Fabric mods also
 * initialise in it again.
 *
 * <h2>The rules, and why ties are broken the way they are</h2>
 *
 * <p>A mod comes after everything it requires, and after everything it declares it loads AFTER. A mod declaring
 * it loads BEFORE another comes first. A requirement naming a mod that is not installed contributes nothing —
 * it is either optional or already reported by the dependency audit, and inventing an edge to a missing node
 * would be a cycle waiting to happen.
 *
 * <p>Ties keep the order they came in, which is the alphabetical one. That is deliberate: a stable tie-break
 * means the same pack constructs in the same order every launch, so a bug that depends on order is reproducible
 * rather than intermittent.
 *
 * <p>A cycle cannot be ordered, and the honest thing is to say so rather than pick a winner silently. The mods
 * in it keep their incoming order and are named in a warning, because a cycle between two mods is a fact about
 * those mods that their authors need to hear.
 *
 * <p>Escape hatch: {@code -Dneoforbric.modOrder=name} restores the file-name order for a pack that somehow needs it.
 * For the order Fabric mods initialise in, it matters only together with {@code -Dneoforbric.fabricOrder=off}.
