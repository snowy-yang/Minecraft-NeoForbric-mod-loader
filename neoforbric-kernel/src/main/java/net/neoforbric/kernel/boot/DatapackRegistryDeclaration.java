 * {@code @Inject} at {@code RegistryDataLoader.<clinit>} TAIL is the documented way to add a worldgen registry, and
 * WorldWeaver's runs every {@code wover.datapack.registry} entrypoint from there. On native Fabric that happens at
 * world load, after every main entrypoint. The kernel forced it from {@code Main.main} on a client, before any
 * Fabric main had run and with {@code minecraft:root} frozen — so wover-biome's codec registry, which its own main
 * would have created, was created from the initialiser instead and threw "Registry is already frozen". The
 * {@code ExceptionInInitializerError} marks both classes erroneous for the rest of the process, and every
 * {@code WorldLoader.load} and multiplayer join then dies on "Could not initialize class". This class holds the
 * decisions that keep that from happening, and the report for when it happens anyway.
