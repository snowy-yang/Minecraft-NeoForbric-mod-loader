/**
 * Resolves a registry alias for the registries whose lookups are traditional-Forge wrappers.
 *
 * <p>A registry alias lets a mod rename an entry without breaking the old id: {@code waystones:waystone} is an
 * alias for {@code waystones:andesite_waystone}, and waystones' own datapack still says {@code waystones:waystone}.
 * Both loader families support this — NeoForge in {@code BaseMappedRegistry}, fabric-api in
 * {@code fabric-registry-sync-v0}'s {@code MappedRegistryMixin} — and on a genuine instance exactly one of those is
 * live and complete.
 *
 * <p>On the merged base NEITHER is complete. NeoForge's {@code IRegistryExtension.addAlias} did not survive the
 * byte merge at all: the merged {@code MappedRegistry} has no {@code addAlias}. fabric-api's mixin does, and it
 * wins by default — so a NEOFORGE mod's alias call lands in fabric-api's map, which is fine. But fabric-api
 * implements the READING half as {@code @ModifyVariable} on eight {@code MappedRegistry} lookups, and
 * {@code BuiltInRegistries.BLOCK} on the merged base is a {@code net.minecraftforge.registries
 * .NamespacedDefaultedWrapper} — a {@code MappedRegistry} subclass that OVERRIDES every one of those eight to
 * delegate to a {@code ForgeRegistry}. {@code addAlias} is mixin-ADDED, so it is inherited and works. The eight
 * readers are overridden, so the rewrite never runs. Aliases are recorded and never honoured.
 *
 * <p>What that costs: waystones' own {@code configured_feature} JSON says {@code waystones:waystone}, the block
 * lookup misses, {@code Failed to parse waystones:waystone from pack …}, and because waystones also adds those ids
 * to the VANILLA {@code minecraft:enchantable/durability} tag, that tag drops too and vanilla's own
 * {@code minecraft:mending}, {@code unbreaking} and {@code vanishing_curse} fail to parse with it. One unresolved
 * alias takes the whole registry load down. It stayed invisible only because nothing read a Forge-family mod's
 * {@code data/} until {@link KernelDataPacks} started serving it.
 *
 * <p>This class is the reading half, put back on the wrapper by {@code RegistryAliasParityInjector}. It mirrors
 * fabric-api's semantics exactly — {@code aliases.getOrDefault(id, id)} for an {@code Identifier}, and for a
 * {@code ResourceKey} a null-safe lookup that rebuilds the key in the same registry — because the point is parity,
 * not a second opinion. It reads fabric-api's map rather than keeping one of its own, so an alias registered
 * through either ecosystem resolves in both.
