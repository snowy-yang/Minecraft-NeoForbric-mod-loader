/**
 * A future whose value is computed the first time anyone looks at it, and which from then on is an ordinary
 * completed future.
 *
 * <p>It exists for one field: NeoForge's {@code ModFile.futureScanResult}, which FML fills by
 * {@code startScan(executor)} — a background scan of every jar at discovery time. The kernel runs no FML
 * discovery and must not walk every jar at boot for the few mods that ever ask, and a seeded {@code ModFile} with
 * the field left null answers {@code getScanResult()} with "Scanning of this mod file has not started yet." So the
 * field holds this instead: "started", and done the moment it is read.
 *
 * <p>Every read path computes first — {@code get}, {@code join}, {@code getNow}, {@code resultNow} and the state
 * queries alike — so it never shows the half-state a real in-flight future has: a caller that checks
 * {@code isDone()} before {@code getNow(null)} gets the value, not its default. The composition methods
 * ({@code thenApply} and the rest) are left as they are; they are unreachable here, because the field is private
 * and {@code ModFile}'s only read of it is {@code get()} (verified on the carrier's bytecode: {@code startScan}
 * only null-checks it).
 *
 * <p>The supplier is expected to answer rather than throw. If it throws anyway, that becomes the future's
 * exceptional completion, which {@code ModFile.getScanResult()} reports the way it reports a failed FML scan.

	 * loading came back to this same file's {@code getScanResult()} would find the supplier already taken and then
	 * wait in {@code super.get()} for a result only it could produce: a silent hang on the main thread. It is refused
