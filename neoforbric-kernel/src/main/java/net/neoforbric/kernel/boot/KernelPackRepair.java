/**
 * The boot-side hooks for the two pack repairs, and the one place the whole failure is written down.
 *
 * <p>A merged base runs two sets of patches over one {@code Pack.readPackMetadata}, and they collide. NeoForge's
 * patch appends its own {@code neoforge:overlays} to the vanilla overlay list, and it does that the obvious way —
 * copy into an {@code ArrayList}, {@code addAll}, freeze. fabric-api's {@code fabric-resource-conditions-api-v1}
 * ships a mixin that hooks every STORE of that same local and always hands back a {@code List.copyOf}, i.e. an
 * IMMUTABLE list. On Fabric there is exactly one such store and nothing mutates the local afterwards, so the
 * mixin is right. On NeoForge there is no such mixin, so the patch is right. Merged, the mixin intercepts the
 * store NeoForge's patch just made and the very next instruction is {@code addAll} on an immutable list.
 *
 * <p>What that costs is out of all proportion to it. {@code readPackMetadata} catches {@code Exception} across
 * its whole body, so the {@code UnsupportedOperationException} becomes a {@code null} return; {@code
 * Pack.readMetaAndCreate} turns that into a {@code null} pack; a mod that does not null-check hands the null to
 * the consumer it was given, and {@code PackRepository.discoverAvailable} dies on
 * {@code Cannot invoke "Pack.streamSelfAndChildren()" because "pack" is null}. One list's mutability, and the
 * world will not load.
 *
 * <p>{@link #concat} is the repair: the merged base stops assuming a mutability it can no longer guarantee.
 * {@link #nullPackSkipped} is the backstop one layer out, because a {@code RepositorySource} emitting a null pack
 * is always a bug in that source — vanilla's own sources null-check before calling the consumer, and NeoForge's
 * {@code ResourcePackLoader} does too. Both, not either: the backstop alone would turn a loud crash into a
 * silently missing pack and quietly wrong terrain, which is the worse failure.
