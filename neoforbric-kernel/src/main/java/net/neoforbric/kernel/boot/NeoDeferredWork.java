/**
 * Runs a NeoForge {@code DeferredWorkQueue} on the thread NeoForge runs it on.
 *
 * <p><b>Which thread runs the deferred work is part of the contract</b>, and the kernel got it wrong by running
 * it on the caller's. NeoForge dispatches every parallel phase through
 * {@code ModLoader.dispatchParallelEvent}, whose tail is
 * {@code runInitTask(name, ModWorkManager.syncExecutor(), periodicTask, queue::runTasks)} — and
 * {@code ModWorkManager.syncExecutor()} is {@code Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor}, a daemon thread called
 * {@code modloading-sync-worker}. So NeoForge's deferred tasks do <b>not</b> run on the render thread; the render
 * thread is parked waiting for them.
 *
 * <p>That distinction is load-bearing for any mod whose deferred task calls {@code Minecraft.execute}.
 * {@code BlockableEventLoop.execute} runs a task INLINE when it is already on the game thread and QUEUES it
 * otherwise — and {@code Minecraft.gameThread} is assigned early in {@code Minecraft.<init>}, long before client
 * mod loading. Firing the queue on the render thread therefore turns "run this in the game loop" into "run this
 * right now", inside the constructor.
 *
 * <p>What that cost: {@code ClientModLoader.finish()} — where the kernel anchors NeoForge client setup, because
 * it is where NeoForge does it too — sits ~70 bytes BEFORE {@code resourceManager.createReload(...)} in
 * {@code Minecraft.<init>}. A task that meant to run in the game loop instead ran while
 * {@code ReloadableResourceManager} still held its empty placeholder, so every {@code getResource} came back
 * empty. Xaero's World Map does exactly this: its client setup enqueues work that calls
 * {@code Minecraft.getInstance().execute(this::loadLaterClientRender)}, which reads
 * {@code xaeroworldmap:vanilla_states.dat} off the resource manager and calls {@code Optional.get()} on it —
 * {@code NoSuchElementException}, and the mod's own crash handler took the client down on the first tick.
 *
 * <p>Borrowing NeoForge's executor rather than making our own is deliberate: same thread name, same daemon flag,
 * same single-thread serialisation between phases, and the context classloader a mod sees is the one it would
 * see under NeoForge.
