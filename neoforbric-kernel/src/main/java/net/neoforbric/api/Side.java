/**
 * Which physical side this process is: the one side vocabulary for all three ecosystems.
 *
 * <p>The kernel had four spellings of this. {@code net.fabricmc.api.EnvType} stood in as the kernel's own notion;
 * sixteen methods took a bare {@code boolean client}; the string {@code client ? "CLIENT" : "DEDICATED_SERVER"}
 * was written out six times in four files; and {@code KernelBoot.Side} carried the boot-time version of it. None
 * of them is wrong on its own. What they cost is that nothing connects them, so a site can disagree with the
 * others and compile — which two of them did:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code PassiveSeeder.seedForgeFmlLoader} used to hardcode {@code DEDICATED_SERVER}, so on a NeoForbric
 *       CLIENT, traditional MinecraftForge believed it was a dedicated server.</li>
 *   <li>{@code KernelBoot} passed {@code side == Side.SERVER} as FML's {@code production} flag, which is the
 *       dev-vs-shipped axis and has nothing to do with which side is running — so every client boot announced
 *       {@code production=false}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Both were expressible because a side had been taken apart into loose booleans and strings before it reached
 * the code that needed it. This type exists so it arrives whole.
 *
 * <h2>The constant names are the Forge families' own</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #distName()} is the name of the matching constant in {@code Dist} — and it is the SAME name in
 * MinecraftForge's {@code net.minecraftforge.api.distmarker.Dist} and NeoForge's
 * {@code net.neoforged.api.distmarker.Dist} (see {@link ForeignType#DIST}; the class names differ, the constants
 * do not). Fabric's {@code EnvType} spells the server side {@code SERVER} instead, which is why the conversion
 * to and from it stays on the kernel side rather than being folded in here — this package names no ecosystem's
 * types.
