/**
 * Every mod running in this instance, from every ecosystem, with what it takes to SHOW one to a player.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link ModPresence} answers "is mod X installed" and stops there, because that is all a compatibility branch
 * needs. A mod list is the other question: a player opening the Mods screen wants the whole set, with names,
 * versions and descriptions, and there was no place that held it. Each family's screen reads its own family's
 * registry — NeoForge's {@code ModListScreen} reads {@code ModList.get()}, Mod Menu reads Fabric's containers —
 * so on a NeoForbric instance running 16 jars across three ecosystems, NeoForge's screen listed three of them and
 * Mod Menu listed the Fabric ones plus a row of question marks for everything it could only see as a bare id.
 *
 * <p>Neither screen is wrong. Each is complete for the loader it was written against, and no loader on a normal
 * instance has to answer for another one's mods. This catalogue is the answer for an instance that does.
 *
 * <h2>What it is not</h2>
 *
 * <p>Display metadata, and nothing else. Publishing a mod here gives it no container, no event bus, no config and
 * no place in any family's loading list — a multiplayer handshake announces a loading list, and a Fabric mod must
 * not turn into something this client claims to run under MinecraftForge. {@link ModPresence} draws that line for
 * presence; this draws the same one for display.
 *
 * <p>It is also not the arbitration result. A jar suppressed as a cross-ecosystem duplicate is not running and
 * does not appear; what appears is the winner, under the ecosystem that won it.
 *
 * <h2>Publishing</h2>
 *
 * <p>Once, during boot, by whoever has all three ecosystems' mods in hand — which is exactly one place. Readers
 * are game-side (the Mods screen), so this lives in {@code net.neoforbric.api}, which is parent-loaded: the screen
 * and the boot code that filled it see the same class and the same list.
