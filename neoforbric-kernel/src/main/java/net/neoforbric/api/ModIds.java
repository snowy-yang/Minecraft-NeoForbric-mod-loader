/**
 * Finds the mod a dependency means when the two ecosystems spell the same library's id differently.
 *
 * <p>Cloth Config is the case that found this. The Fabric build declares {@code "id":"cloth-config"}; the
 * MinecraftForge and NeoForge builds declare {@code modId = "cloth_config"}. One project, one author, one set of
 * {@code me.shedaniel.clothconfig2} classes — two spellings, because each ecosystem's id conventions were settled
 * separately and neither side has any reason to declare the other's name. On a single-ecosystem loader that never
 * shows: you install the build for your loader and the id its dependents ask for is the one it declares.
 *
 * <p>On NeoForbric it shows immediately. A NeoForge mod requiring {@code cloth_config} sits next to the Fabric Cloth
 * Config whose classes it will happily link against at runtime, and every id-keyed lookup says NOT INSTALLED —
 * the dependency dialog accuses the player of a missing mod that is in their mods folder, and
 * {@link net.neoforbric.kernel.boot.ModConstructionOrder} draws no edge, so the dependent can construct first.
 *
 * <p>The rule is punctuation, and only punctuation: {@code -}, {@code _}, {@code .} and spaces are dropped and the
 * rest is lowercased. It is applied ONLY after the exact id (and every {@code provides} alias) has already missed,
 * and only when exactly ONE installed mod collapses to the same key. Two candidates and it declines, because a
 * silenced real dependency is worse than a spelling this does not know: the dialog's whole value is being
 * believed, and it can only be believed while it never covers something up.
 *
 * <p>Measured before it was trusted: across a 97-jar three-ecosystem pack, 102 distinct declared ids collapse to
 * 102 distinct keys — no two mods collide at all.
 *
 * <p>{@code -Dneoforbric.crossEcosystemIds=off} restores exact-id matching.
