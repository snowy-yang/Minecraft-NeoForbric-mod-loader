/**
 * A mod dependency in NeoForbric's unified model, normalized from a Fabric {@code depends}/{@code recommends} entry
 * or a Forge-family {@code [[dependencies]]} entry.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #getVersionConstraint() version constraint} is a Fabric-style predicate ({@code ">=0.15.0"},
 * {@code ">=47 <48"}); Maven ranges are translated into that form by {@code ForgeVersionRangeTranslator} when the
 * dependency is built. {@link #isSatisfiedBy} evaluates it, so a caller never has to know which ecosystem the
 * requirement came from — that is what makes this "unified" rather than merely "shared".
 *
 * <h2>What the Forge families say that Fabric has no word for</h2>
 *
 * <p>A Forge {@code [[dependencies]]} entry carries two axes Fabric's {@code depends} map cannot express: load
 * {@link Ordering ordering} relative to the other mod, and the {@link SideScope sides} the requirement applies
 * to. Both were read by the parser and then dropped on the floor here, which made this type's name a promise it
 * did not keep. They are carried as DATA, per family, exactly as they were written — not folded into some average
 * that both families would then be slightly wrong about.
 *
 * <p>The side matters for more than tidiness: a client-only requirement counted as unconditional turns a dedicated
 * server into a false report of a missing mod, and a hard-failing resolver would refuse to start over it.
