/**
 * The {@code IModFile} behind a kernel-constructed mod: its real jar when it has one, a placeholder when it does
 * not.
 *
 * <h2>What this class made visible</h2>
 *
 * <p>It replaces a {@link java.lang.reflect.Proxy} that switched on method NAMES and answered everything it did
 * not name through a {@code defaultReturn} — null for objects, false for booleans, empty for collections. Four
 * of this interface's ten methods were named; the other six were answered by that fallback, and nothing anywhere
 * said so. Written as a class, javac lists all ten and each one is now a line with a reason next to it.
 *
 * <p>The class was first written answering every one of those the way the proxy had, deliberately, so that the
 * rewrite could not move behaviour — and it recorded that four of them were almost certainly wrong. This is that
 * separate change: {@link #getId()}, {@link #getFileName()}, {@link #getType()} and {@link #getModFileInfo()}
 * now answer with the values a real mod file has. Each was null, and null is not a value any consumer expects
 * from them: a mod filtering the file list by type dropped every kernel-loaded mod, and a mod walking from a
 * file back to its info — the direction NeoForge's own error path takes — dereferenced null.

	 * Sodium's third-party config hooks) finds what it would on the carrier. Only a jar-less presence alias — a
