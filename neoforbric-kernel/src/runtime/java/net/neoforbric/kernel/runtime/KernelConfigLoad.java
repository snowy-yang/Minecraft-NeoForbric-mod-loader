 * {@code KernelLifecycle}, where {@code lateConfigTypes} has a test and its javadoc records why SERVER is absent
 * from both lists. This is only the doing.
 *
 * <h2>The one member that stays reflective</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code ConfigTracker.openConfig} is package-private static, and it is the only entry point that opens ONE
 * config. {@code loadConfigs} is public and is the wrong call for the late pass: it re-opens every config of the
 * type, and the carrier's second open warns and installs a SECOND file watcher, so every later edit of that file
 * fires the reload twice.
