/**
 * Turns the kernel's own annotation scan into NeoForge's {@code ModFileScanData} — the index FML hands to mods,
 * and the only way several of them find their own extensions.
 *
 * <p>The scanning itself is pure bytecode work and stays on the boot side in {@code ModFileScanner}. Only this
 * last step needs game types, and doing it from up there took three {@code Class.forName} calls, two constructor
 * lookups written out by exact parameter list, and two {@code getMethod} calls — six independent strings holding
 * up an index whose ONLY failure mode is silence. Nothing throws when an index comes out wrong or empty; the mods
 * reading it simply find nothing. JEI is the loud exception, and only by accident: its {@code ForgePluginFinder}
 * turns an empty result into {@code IllegalArgumentException: plugins must not be empty} out of its own
 * {@code @Mod} constructor. Jade, Sophisticated Core and Sodium's third-party config hooks fail silently, which
 * is worse.
 *
 * <p>So these two constructors being checked by javac is the whole point of this file. If a future NeoForge
 * reorders {@code AnnotationData}'s five components, this stops compiling. Before, it kept working and every mod
 *'s plugin list went quietly empty.
