/**
 * Registers a Fabric mod's config with the REAL {@code ConfigTracker}, from a caller that expects an older shape.
 *
 * <p>ForgeConfigAPIPort exists so Fabric mods can use NeoForge's config API, and it ships its own
 * {@code net.neoforged.fml.config.ConfigTracker} to provide it. Under NeoForbric that package is {@code ALWAYS_GAME},
 * so the carrier's class wins and the port's never loads — and the port's compiled call sites then ask for
 * {@code registerConfig(ModConfig$Type, IConfigSpec, String, String)}, keyed by mod ID, which real NeoForge
 * 26.2.0.88 does not have. It takes a {@code ModContainer}. The result is a {@code NoSuchMethodError} raised not
 * by the port but by whichever mod first registered a config through it, which is how a ShoulderSurfing crash in
 * {@code Minecraft.<init>} came to be a config-API bug.
 *
 * <p>So the ID gets a container. Not a published one: it is identity for the tracker and nothing else. The
 * tracker keys its per-mod lock by {@code container.getModId()} and posts config events through
 * {@code container.acceptEvent}, and that is the whole surface used here.
 *
 * <p><b>The bus is the mod's own, and used to be null.</b> {@code ModContainer.acceptEvent} is final and begins
 * by returning when its bus is null — so a null bus was a legal and completely silent way to throw away every
 * config event the tracker posted. That is the whole point of the port's API: a Fabric mod registers a callback
 * for "my config loaded" or "my config was edited on disk", and none of them ever fired. ShoulderSurfing-Fabric
 * reads its settings from exactly that callback.
 *
 * <p>A PRIVATE bus per mod, not the NeoForge baseline's: the baseline's would fan a Fabric mod's
 * {@code ModConfigEvent.Loading} out to NeoForge's own listeners under a foreign mod ID. Nothing else subscribes
 * to these buses; the kernel puts one listener on each and forwards to the port's own dispatcher.
 *
 * <p>One container per ID, cached: a fresh one per call would give each of a mod's configs a different event sink
 * and a different lock.
