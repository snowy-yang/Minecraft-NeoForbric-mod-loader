/**
 * The game side of serving a Forge-family mod jar's own {@code data/} to the server datapack repository.
 *
 * <p>{@code KernelDataPacks} keeps the policy — which jars carry data, who owns them, what each pack is called
 * and in what order they stack. None of that names a game type and all of it has tests. What lives here is the
 * part that could only be spelled reflectively: building a {@code Pack} and handing a {@code RepositorySource}
 * to the repository.
 *
 * <h2>What being typed changed</h2>
 *
 * <p>The source was a {@code Proxy} dispatching on method NAME with {@code default -> null}. That is a shape
 * that cannot fail loudly: a method the interface gains, or one whose name moves, is answered with null and
 * nobody hears about it. {@code RepositorySource} declares exactly one method today, and the difference is that
 * javac now says so — if it ever declares two, this stops compiling instead of quietly answering null to the
 * second.
 *
 * <p>Metadata is read through NeoForge's own {@code readWithOptionalMeta} rather than synthesised. That path
 * reads the jar's real {@code pack.mcmeta} with an unlimited supported-format range and tolerates a jar with
 * none, which is the genuine loader's behaviour — and, unlike a synthesised {@code Pack.Metadata}, it keeps a
 * mod's root-pack {@code overlays}.

	 * <p>The selection config is NeoForge's own {@code MOD_PACK_SELECTION_CONFIG} shape:
	 * {@code (required=false, TOP, fixed=false)}. Not required, because that is how a genuine instance treats a
	 * mod pack — the server auto-enables one it has not seen ("Found new data pack …, loading it automatically")
	 * and forcing it would take away the operator's ability to turn a mod's data off. TOP, so mod data overrides
