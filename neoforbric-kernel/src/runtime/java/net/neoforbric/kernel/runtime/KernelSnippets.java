/**
 * Carries NeoForge's stencil test from {@code RenderPipeline$Builder.buildSnippet} into the vanilla-shaped
 * 11-argument {@code RenderPipeline$Snippet} constructor, so the call site can construct through that
 * constructor (which fabric-rendering-v1's {@code @WrapOperation} handler matches) without losing the twelfth
 * argument NeoForge added.
 *
 * <p>{@code SnippetConstructorFunnel} makes {@code buildSnippet} call {@link #scope} with the Builder's stencil
 * test right before {@code new Snippet(11 args)}, and makes the 11-arg constructor read {@link #take} where it
 * used to read {@code Optional.empty()} before delegating to the 12-arg constructor. {@link #clear} follows the
 * construction so a value never outlives its call site. Thread-local: pipelines are built on whichever thread
 * registers them, never two on one thread at once, and a construction by anyone else on the same thread between
 * {@code scope} and the constructor is impossible on the rewritten straight-line path.
