/**
 * The {@code IModFileInfo} a kernel-constructed mod reports as its owning file.
 *
 * <p>It exists because NeoForge's error path dereferences it: when ANY mod-bus event listener throws,
 * {@code ModContainer.acceptEvent} → {@code ModLoadingIssue.withAffectedMod} walks
 * {@code getOwningFile().getFile().getFilePath()}. Against a null owning file that walk NPEs and MASKS the real
 * listener error — caught empirically on the client's {@code RegisterKeyMappingsEvent}, where the actual cause
 * was invisible until this chain existed.
 *
 * <p>Three of this interface's ten methods were named by the proxy this replaces; the other seven fell through
 * to a default. The version string now follows the carriers' first-mod contract as well: a null there prevented
 * Player Animation Library from constructing when it checked whether its own version contained "dev".
 *
 * <p>{@link #getConfig()} was null here, while {@code IModInfo.getConfig()} on the very same mod was carefully
 * non-null, and it was left that way until a reader was established. There is more than one. Not Enough Crashes
 * builds its description of every mod it names from {@code getOwningFile().getConfig().getConfigElement(
 * "issueTrackerURL")} and threw on the null, and NeoForge's own mod-loading crash report asks the same object for
 * the same key.
