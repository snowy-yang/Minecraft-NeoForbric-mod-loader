/**
 * A concrete {@code ModContainer} over a kernel-owned event bus.
 *
 * <p>{@code ModContainer} is abstract with exactly one abstract method, {@code getEventBus()}, and a public
 * constructor taking {@code IModInfo}. The kernel used to emit this subclass with an ASM {@code ClassWriter} at
 * boot — about forty visitor calls spelling out a constructor and a getter — because before the game side had a
 * delivery path there was nowhere to compile it.
 *
 * <p>This is the FALLBACK container. {@link KernelContainers} prefers a genuine {@code FMLModContainer}, because
 * real NeoForge library mods resolve their own bus with {@code ModList.get().getModContainerById(id)} and then
 * narrow to that type — Bookshelf does exactly this and threw "Mod 'bookshelf' is not an FML mod!" against a
 * kernel-generated type, aborting its construction. A subclass satisfies every abstract-typed call but not an
 * {@code instanceof}, so this one is reached only where the genuine class cannot be built.
