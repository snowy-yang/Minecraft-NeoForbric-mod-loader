/**
 * Gives a name to a client reload listener NeoForge refuses to name, instead of letting it kill the client.
 *
 * <h2>Why a listener with no name is fatal here and nowhere else</h2>
 *
 * <p>NeoForge sorts client reload listeners in a graph keyed by {@code Identifier}, and
 * {@code AddClientReloadListenersEvent.lookupName} is where a listener already present in the manager gets its
 * key. It asks {@code VanillaClientListeners.getNameForClass}, and when that returns null it THROWS: "A
 * non-vanilla reload listener … was added via mixin before the AddClientReloadListenerEvent! Mod-added listeners
 * must go through that event." That assertion is written for an instance where the only mods are NeoForge mods.
 *
 * <p>Adding a reload listener by mixin is ordinary Fabric practice — it is how a Fabric mod has always done it,
 * and there is no event for it to go through. So on a tri-ecosystem instance the assertion fires on correct mod
 * code, from inside {@code ClientHooks.initClientHooks}, which runs inside {@code Minecraft.<init>}: vistas took
 * the whole client down before it drew a frame.
 *
 * <h2>What the name is for, and why synthesising one is not a workaround</h2>
 *
 * <p>The name is a sort key and a registry key, nothing more: {@code SortedReloadListenerEvent} holds
 * {@code Map<Identifier, listener>}, {@code Map<listener, Identifier>} and a dependency graph over them. A
 * listener with a synthesised unique name is therefore a listener that is registered, sorted and RUN — which is
 * the whole difference between this and catching the exception. Derived from the class, so it is stable across
 * runs and unique by construction; a second listener of the same class would collide, and that is reported.
