 * Peeling the wrapper off a reflective failure — one layer, and only for the one exception type.

 * <p>Every kernel diagnostic that reports a reflective call's failure goes through this. Get it wrong in the
 * direction of peeling too eagerly and a genuine reflection fault is reported as whatever it happened to wrap;
 * get it wrong in the direction of not peeling and the log carries an {@code InvocationTargetException} whose
 * own message is null, which says nothing at all.
