/**
 * The guard's decision rule, driven directly.
 *
 * <p>Split out of the injected {@code execute} for exactly this: the rule is the whole risk. A guard that
 * is too eager does not fail loudly, it rejects legitimate chunk work during a normal shutdown and takes
 * the save with it — so "alive means never reject" needs an assertion, not a comment.
 *
 * <p>This class names no game type, which is why it can be tested at all on a machine with no staged
 * Minecraft artifacts.
