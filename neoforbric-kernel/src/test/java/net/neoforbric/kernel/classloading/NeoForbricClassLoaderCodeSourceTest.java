/**
 * Covers {@link NeoForbricClassLoader#jarUrlOf} — which URL a defined class's code source points at.
 *
 * <p>Classes used to be defined with no protection domain, so every mod's {@code getProtectionDomain()
 * .getCodeSource()} answered null. A mod that ships data beside its own classes reads that to find its own jar,
 * and a null is an NPE inside the mod. The code source has to name the JAR, not the class entry inside it: that
 * is the spelling a caller turns back into a path.
