 *
 * <p>Every lookup is the identity because the kernel runs the merged base in Mojmap and modern mods ship compiled
 * against Mojmap too. That makes the bodies trivial and the contract the whole risk: a mod branches on
 * {@code getCurrentRuntimeNamespace()} to decide whether it must remap at all, so a namespace name that does not
 * appear in {@code getNamespaces()}, or one spelled differently from what the identity mapping actually is, sends
 * that mod down its remapping path — where it would map already-Mojmap names through nothing and get them back
 * unchanged while believing they were translated.
