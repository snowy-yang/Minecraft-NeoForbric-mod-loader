 * What a row's reason text says when the same mod is marked more than once.
 *
 * <p>Two things go wrong here and only one of them was covered. A row must carry a SECOND distinct reason — a
 * mod whose mixin was left out and whose deferred task then threw has two things wrong with it — and it must not
 * carry the same reason twice. The dedup compared the whole incoming text to each existing clause, so a reason
 * that was ITSELF several clauses (one repair naming two things it could not do) never matched, and arriving
 * twice printed it twice. fabric-item-api's tooltip row read that way on the Mods screen and in the load report.
