/**
 * The one-shot a real shared library has, reproduced.
 *
 * <p>Xaero's {@code xaerolib} registers a config channel in {@code XaeroLib.<init>} and throws
 * {@code IllegalArgumentException: Attempted to register a duplicate config channel} on a second registration.
 * This is that, in four lines: whichever platform bootstrap runs first claims the library, and a second one is an
 * error. Both nested copies of this library carry this same class, so on a classpath holding both, one copy of it
 * is loaded (first URL wins) and BOTH bootstraps reach it — which is exactly how the real defect showed up.
