/**
 * A mod that fails the way real mods fail, on purpose.
 *
 * <p>Every gate in this tree asserts that NO mod failed — gate-m4 and gate-m7 both carry a
 * {@code check_absent "no @Mod construction failure"}. That is the right assertion for those gates and it is the
 * opposite of this one. Nothing anywhere proved the other half: that when a mod does fail, the instance carries
 * on and the failure is attributed.
 *
 * <p>Which matters because carrying on is NeoForbric's whole posture. It loads as much as it can rather than
 * stopping at the first problem, and the cost of that trade is exactly this: one mod's failure has to stay one
 * mod's failure, and it has to be findable afterwards. Both halves were asserted only by unit tests over
 * hand-built fixtures until this canary existed.
 *
 * <p>It throws from {@code onInitialize} rather than from a static initializer, because that is where a real mod
 * breaks: a missing transitive dependency, a changed vanilla signature, a config it cannot read. A
 * {@code <clinit>} failure is a different (and rarer) shape and would test the class loader instead.
