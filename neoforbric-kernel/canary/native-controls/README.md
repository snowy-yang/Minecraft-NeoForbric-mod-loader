# Native server controls, Minecraft 26.2

These are three separate mods, each using only Minecraft and its own loader's public API. They have no
NeoForbric runtime dependency and no cross-ecology claims. The same compiled jar and dependency set is used
unchanged on the native and NeoForbric arms. Each arm has a fresh runner-owned world with seed `8035262`.

Pinned native distributions:

- Fabric Loader `0.19.5`, server launcher `1.1.2`, full Fabric API `0.155.2+26.2`.
- Forge `26.2-65.0.1`, installed using its official installer and native shim/server.
- NeoForge `26.2.0.88`, installed using its official installer and native FML server entrypoint.

The declared behavior denominator is one mod initialization, one ServerStarted event, one command
registration, at least 20 real server ticks, and three command actions: registered block identity,
placing the mod's block at `(0,80,0)` in a ServerLevel, and reading that block back. The runner waits for
both `Done` and the 20-tick marker before sending `nativecontrol`, followed by `save-all flush` and `stop`.
This limited control does not test players, rendering, world reload, transfer APIs, Mixins, or arbitrary mods.
M33 is a separate cross-ecology transfer test and cannot run on a native single-ecology loader.

From the worktree root:

```sh
python3 neoforbric-kernel/run/compat/native-controls.py prepare
python3 neoforbric-kernel/run/compat/native-controls.py build
python3 neoforbric-kernel/run/compat/native-controls.py run --engine native
# The root agent schedules this separately: the existing NeoForbric launcher invokes kernel Gradle.
python3 neoforbric-kernel/run/compat/native-controls.py run --engine neoforbric
python3 neoforbric-kernel/run/compat/native-controls.py compare NATIVE_RESULT.json NEOFORBRIC_RESULT.json
```

`--family fabric|forge|neo` selects an arm of prepare/run. Each attempt is retained below
`neoforbric-kernel/build/native-controls/{instances,results}`; the runner never deletes/reuses worlds.
`NATIVE_CONTROL_CACHE` points to the read-only existing download/cache workspace, defaulting to the
original NeoForbric workspace. Only exact upstream-checksummed libraries seed Forge/Neo installations.
The official installer produces and validates their own game jars; no welded NeoForbric loader/carrier is
used by the native arms or by compilation. Fabric copies only native distribution cache directories,
never a cache instance's mods, configs, transformed mod cache, or world.

Each result retains the command, tool version, canary source hashes, compile classpath hashes, native
installer and runtime inputs, complete mod set hashes, fixed seed/actions, full log, explicit startup
and action/event denominators, exit status, freshness token, and input-drift check. A failed arm remains
failed; the runner still attempts the other predeclared arms without changing any mod set. Comparison
requires identical mod hashes, seed and actions. A native startup failure is inconclusive for attributing
a missing action to NeoForbric, never a passing control.
