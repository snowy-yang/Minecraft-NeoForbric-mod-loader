# The kernel implements the Fabric ecosystem itself: it parses fabric.mod.json, extracts JiJ-nested jars, builds
# the mod-facing FabricLoader view, and invokes the entrypoints at the correct lifecycle points — preLaunch before
# any game class loads, `main` inside the registration window (registries unfrozen, so a mod's Registry.register
# works), then the side-specific `server` entrypoint. No net.fabricmc.loader.impl class exists in the process.
#
# The canary (run/build-fabric-canary.sh) is an ordinary Fabric mod: every call it makes is published Fabric API.
