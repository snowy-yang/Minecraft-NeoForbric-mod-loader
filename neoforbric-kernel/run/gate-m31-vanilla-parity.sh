# M31 — with ZERO mods, a NeoForbric world must be the world vanilla generates from the same seed.
#
# Everything else in this directory asks whether NeoForbric can RUN something. This asks whether it changed
# something nobody asked it to change. Nothing did ask, until 2026-09-21: the merged base computed
# nextDouble() in float (`l2f; fmul; f2d` where vanilla has `l2d; dmul`), which displaces every Perlin
# octave's origin, and no gate could see it because no gate had ever compared a NeoForbric world to a vanilla one.
#
# WHAT IS ASSERTED AND WHY IT IS ONLY TWO FACETS. Vanilla does not reproduce ITSELF at the block level: features
# that read a neighbouring chunk (dripstone, sculk) resolve by whichever chunk the worker pool finished first,
# and two runs of unmodified vanilla on this seed differ in 274 of their 400 fully generated chunks. So blocks,
# heightmaps and block entities are printed as evidence and asserted on by nobody. Biomes and structure starts
# carry no such noise — biomes are written at the `biomes` status from the climate sampler alone, before any
# feature runs — and there BOTH vanilla against itself and NeoForbric against itself agree on all 1764 chunks.
# The mob a dungeon spawner was built with is the same kind of fact and is asserted too: it caught the kernel
# drawing it through NeoForge's weighted data map (nextInt(400)) where vanilla draws nextInt(4) — the same
# distribution, a different mob on the same seed, and all six dungeons in this area disagreed. It is compared
# only where both worlds have a spawner at the same spot: a mineshaft corridor's cave spider spawner goes to
# whichever chunk first draws a spot inside itself (vanilla's mutable MineShaftCorridor.hasPlacedSpider), so its
# position follows the worker pool. On this seed vanilla put one at -168,32,-52 three times and NeoForbric at
# -168,32,-46 twice (2026-09-24); spawner positions are evidence.
#
# TEETH (recorded 2026-09-21): M31_UNFIXED=1 runs the NeoForbric arm with -Dneoforbric.randomSourcePrecision=off,
# which puts the float-rounded draw back. The biome check then reports 11 differing chunks and this gate is RED.
