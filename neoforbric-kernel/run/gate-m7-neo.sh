# M7-NeoForge gate — REAL, PURE NeoForge mods (jars that carry ONLY neoforge.mods.toml) run on the kernel.
#
# Why this exists as its own gate: gate-m4's "NeoForge @Mods" all come from UNIVERSAL jars (FallingTree, collective
# ship fabric.mod.json + mods.toml + neoforge.mods.toml, and MultiLoaderArbiter claims them for NeoForge). That
# proves the arbiter and the NeoForge construction path, but a universal jar's NeoForge glue is deliberately thin —
# it registers listeners and returns. A mod distributed ONLY for NeoForge leans on the loader much harder, and the
# first two tried here both failed on things gate-m4 could never surface:
#
#   • Bookshelf   ModList.get().getModContainerById("bookshelf") -> narrowed to FMLModContainer, for its own bus.
#                 The kernel published no mods at all, so this was "Could not find mod 'bookshelf'."; once published
#                 as a generated ModContainer subclass it became "Mod 'bookshelf' is not an FML mod!". The container
#                 has to BE net.neoforged.fml.javafmlmod.FMLModContainer (KernelModContainerFactory now allocates a
#                 genuine one with UnsafeHacks, the NeoForge twin of the traditional-Forge container).
#   • Architectury  EventBusesHooks.whenAvailable("architectury") -> "Mod 'architectury' is not available!".
#
# Both are the same shape: a library mod resolves ITSELF through ModList during its own constructor. So the mod set
# below is deliberately library-heavy — that is where the loader contract actually gets exercised.
#
# The gate also pins the regression that fixing the above exposed: publishing a non-empty ModList made NeoForge's
# own GameData.postRegisterEvents (which the kernel had been calling for its bake) start dispatching RegisterEvent
# a SECOND time through ModLoader.postEventWrapContainerInModOrder. Every DeferredRegister then double-registered
# ("Adding duplicate key 'neoforge:condition_codecs / balm:config'"), and NeoForge's error path answers that with
# RegistryManager.revertToVanilla() — which silently rolled the registries back and destroyed 21 baseline entries.
# The baseline counts below are therefore load-bearing, not decoration: they are how that rollback is detected.
