# -Pneoforbric.stagedRoot moves every task's staged inputs, and only the TEST task needs it to name a run/ directory.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. build.gradle documents -Pneoforbric.stagedRoot=<a directory that does not exist> as the one command
# that reproduces a machine without staged artifacts, to show the boot jar still builds there. The check that the
# tests' root is a run/ directory (they resolve NEOFORBRIC_OLD + '/run') was written straight into the eagerly
# configured test {} block, so it threw while ANY build was configured -- `jar` included -- and the documented
# recipe stopped working. This configures the recipe (a dry run: nothing is built or written), then checks that
# the test task still refuses a root that is not run/ when it runs. A run/ root is the ordinary case, exercised
# by every unit-test run (StagedRootHandoffTest).
#
# Usage: ./test-staged-root.sh      (needs a warm gradle cache; gate-m0 runs it after the unit tests)
