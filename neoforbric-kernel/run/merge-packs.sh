# Merge two modpack folders into ONE NeoForbric instance.
#
# NeoForbric runs Fabric and Forge-family mods in a single game, so two packs can simply be poured into one rundir.
# What makes it non-obvious is what happens to the overlap: a mod installed by BOTH packs (Sodium, Iris, Jade,
# lithostitched … — 10 of them across the two packs this was written against) exists as two different jars claiming
# one mod id. The kernel arbitrates that at boot, keeps one copy, gives the other side back the mod's identity, and
# writes neoforbric-mods.txt + .neoforbric-kernel/merge-report.txt explaining what it chose. This script only has to
# assemble the folder; it deliberately does NOT try to resolve overlap itself.
#
# Usage: merge-packs.sh <pack-A-dir> <pack-B-dir> <target-rundir>
#   where each pack dir is an instance folder (the one containing mods/).
