# M11 — a DEDICATED server brings a config-driven mod stack up to Done.
#
# WHAT THIS GATE IS FOR. Every other server gate boots mods that never read their own config during world setup,
# and the client gates run an INTEGRATED server, which took a different path. So the kernel shipped for months
# with STARTUP and COMMON configs loaded on the client only — the call site literally read `if (client)`, on the
# reasoning that it left the proven server path alone. What it left alone was a dedicated server with no config
# loaded at all.
#
# Loading a spec is also what posts ModConfigEvent.Loading, and that event is how a config framework layered on
# NeoForge learns a mod's config now has values. Balm sets its active config from exactly that listener, so with
# the event never fired Waystones' getActive() — Objects.requireNonNull(...) — threw NPE out of
# setupDynamicRegistries and the server died before Done. Nothing in the crash named a config.
#
# The mod set is the minimum that reproduces it: waystones needs balm (config framework), and balm's own stack
# needs shogi + cookingforblockheads present to construct. fabric-api is here because the failure was first seen
# on a mixed pack and this keeps the gate honest about that.
#
# TEETH: -Dneoforbric.earlyConfigs=off turns this gate RED (measured: getActive NPE x4, Done never reached).
# GATE-PARALLEL: rundirs=server-config mem=2000
