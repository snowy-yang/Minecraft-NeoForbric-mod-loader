# sweep90-win-r7c died at world join on that alone. Axiom 6.1.3 builds its Dear ImGui font atlas on the first frame
# it draws, for zh_cn from two Noto CJK fonts (7.7 + 11.5 MB) read into byte[]s it does not keep. Its bundled
# imgui-java (imgui.moulberry92, Dear ImGui 1.92.7) pins each array only for the add call, while since 1.92 the atlas
# keeps that pointer and reads it again at build(); a GC in between moves or frees the array, stb_truetype reads a
# garbage cmap format (imstb_truetype.h:1590) and the binding's assert handler calls System.exit(1). The CJK reads
# are humongous allocations, which start exactly such a GC once a full pack has filled the heap. It is not NeoForbric's:
# native Fabric 0.19.5 with only Axiom and fabric-api asserts on the same line in zh_cn once a GC lands between the
# add and the build — forced, or under -XX:+UseSerialGC -Xmn16m; under default G1 that minimal native pack did not
# crash in the runs recorded. en_us narrows the race rather than closing it — four fonts, ~570 KB, no humongous read:
# under that same young generation native Fabric does not assert, and this pack joins and leaves cleanly on NeoForbric.

# startedCleanly to false and saves, and only onGameLoadFinished saves it true again — a client killed while it loads
# leaves false, and the player's next start resets their fullscreen mode. So for as long as a sweep's block runs, this
# record keeps the player's file as it was (`original`, base64; `absent` when there was none), what the sweep changed
# in it (`lang` it wrote, None under `player` and when there was no file; `was`, the line it replaced), and who wrote
# it (`pid` and `started`).
# It outlives the block only when its writer dies before its own restore:
#   - push-and-run's stop kills the driver along with the client. Before its kill it notes that the record's writer is
#     alive; after the kill it puts `original` back whole, as the writer's own finally would have
#     (push-and-run.py `stop_command`, whose Python twin is note_sweep_writer / restore_after_stop).
#   - anything else — a reboot, the driver dying on its own — leaves it for whoever comes next, the stop or a client or
#     bisect driver, and they find a writer that is gone. By then the player may have played and changed settings, so
#     only the lang line goes back, and only while it still names the sweep's language (restore_player_language).
# The writer is a pid together with its process's start time, because after a reboot Windows gives the pid to some

    pause-when-empty-seconds is the load-bearing line and it is easy to lose. Vanilla defaults it to 60

    with that `return` landing BEFORE tickCount++ and before EventHooks.fireServerTickPre. So without this line
    the server stops ticking sixty seconds after Done and every further second of the soak is a paused JVM: no
    tick, no mod tick event, no log line. In build/compat/mix80-verify4 that is visible as `Server empty for 60
    seconds, pausing` at Done+60 with nothing after it until the stop at Done+90 — thirty seconds of every
    sweep spent proving nothing.

    Zero DISABLES the pause (the `i <= 0` branch above); it does not mean pause immediately. With it, the whole
    of --tick-seconds is real simulation, and raising that flag buys what it looks like it buys.

    keeps in the one-element list `last_output` from inside its output pump.

    Without the second one there is only the first, and the difference is fifteen minutes. Across the sixteen
