"""Name the mods that actually REFERENCE a set of symbols — by default the Fabric API
surfaces pinned by MergedBaseMixinCompat.

Usage: fapi-usage.py [--preset NAME | --symbols FILE] [--list-presets] <jar-or-mods-dir>...

Only class references are evidence; resource strings and dependency declarations
do not establish API use. Nested META-INF/jars are scanned with their parent label.

WHY THE SYMBOL SET IS A PARAMETER. This script answered exactly one question --
"who consumes the four suppressed Fabric API surfaces" -- with the answer's
prefixes frozen in a constant. The same two judgements it already gets right
(constant-pool references only; a bundled API defining itself is not a use of it)
are what "which mods are actually WAITING on this Forge event" needs, and that
question has no tool at all: the event-hook censuses in this project were done by
hand with `javap` and written into javadoc, so they are true on the day they are
written and unfalsifiable afterwards. Two copies of this scanner would be two
places for the evidence rules to drift, so the prefixes move out to data and the
file keeps its name.

Symbol-file / preset format: one entry per line, `#` comments and blanks ignored.
  net/minecraftforge/event/        a reference INTO this prefix is a use
  !net/minecraftforge/             a class whose OWN name is under this prefix is
                                   DEFINING the API, not using it -- skip it

The `!` lines are explicit rather than derived from the symbol prefixes, because
guessing the owning package from the surface is exactly the kind of inference that
turns "this mod ships the API" into "this mod consumes the API".
