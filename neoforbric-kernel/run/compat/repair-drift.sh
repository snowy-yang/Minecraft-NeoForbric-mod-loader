# What a CANDIDATE game build would do to the 49 repairs this tree carries.
#
# Every repair is calibrated against one pair of carrier versions, so "fixed" has a half-life. The 26.2.0.38-beta
# -> .88 bump gave RegistryDataLoader.load a fifth parameter; fabric-api's WorldLoaderMixin stopped replacing the
# list, and every datapack registry a Fabric mod declared silently vanished. Nothing measured that. The staged
# test proves the repairs land on the base that is HERE, which says nothing about the one that is coming.
#
# Run this before adopting a carrier bump, not after a player reports it.
#
# Usage: ./repair-drift.sh <candidate-merged-base.jar> [<carrier.jar> ...]
#        ./repair-drift.sh                     # the currently staged build, as a baseline
