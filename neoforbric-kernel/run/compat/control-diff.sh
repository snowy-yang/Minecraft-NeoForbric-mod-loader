# Is this symptom NeoForbric's, or would it happen on a native loader too?
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. "Is this NeoForbric's fault" has been answered by argument, not by experiment. One adversarial
# round rejected 24 of 56 root causes; the single time a native Fabric instance was built to compare against, it
# turned "the mod is broken" into "the kernel froze the registries too early" in one run. Attribution accuracy
# is a product problem in its own right — a wrong verdict costs a day either way, and the mod author gets the
# bug report either way.
#
# So: boot the SAME Fabric mods twice, once on a native Fabric server and once on NeoForbric, and say which log the
# symptom appears in. Four verdicts, and three of them stop an investigation before it starts:
#
#   NEOFORBRIC-ONLY   the kernel's, and the only one worth debugging here
#   BOTH           upstream's or the mod's own; a native loader does it too
#   NATIVE-ONLY    the kernel is masking something; rare and worth a second look
#   NEITHER        not reproduced by this mod set — the repro is wrong, not the verdict
#
# Fabric mods only, by construction: a native Fabric server cannot load the other two ecosystems, and a
# comparison whose arms run different mods answers nothing.
#
# Usage: ./control-diff.sh <symptom-ERE> [<mod.jar> ...]
#        (with no jars, fabric-api plus Macaw's Bridges — enough to register content and sync a registry)
