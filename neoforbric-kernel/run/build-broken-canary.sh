# Builds the canary mod that fails on purpose, for gate-m24-brokenmod.sh.
#
# Every gate in this tree asserts that NO mod failed — gate-m4 and gate-m7 each carry a
# check_absent "no @Mod construction failure". That is the right assertion for those gates, and it is the exact
# opposite of the one nobody had: when a mod DOES fail, does the instance carry on, and is the failure findable
# afterwards.
#
# Which is the whole cost of NeoForbric's posture. It loads as much as it can rather than stopping at the first
# problem, so one mod's failure has to stay one mod's failure. Until this canary existed, both halves of that
# were asserted only by unit tests over hand-built fixtures.
