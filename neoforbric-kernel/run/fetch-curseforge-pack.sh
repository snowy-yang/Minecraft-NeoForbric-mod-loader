# Materialise a CurseForge modpack zip into a NeoForbric rundir.
#
# A CurseForge pack zip contains NO mods — only manifest.json (projectID/fileID pairs), modlist.html and
# overrides/. The mods must be fetched from CurseForge's own endpoint, which needs no API key:
#
#   https://www.curseforge.com/api/v1/mods/<projectID>/files/<fileID>/download
#     -> 307 edge.forgecdn.net -> 302 mediafilez.forgecdn.net/files/<first4>/<rest>/<Name>.jar -> 200
#
# TWO TRAPS, both of which have bitten this project:
#
#  1. NONE of those three responses carries a Content-Disposition header. `curl -OJ` therefore falls back to the
#     URL's last path segment, which is the literal word "download" — so every file is written to ONE file and
#     they overwrite each other. Observed: 66 reported successes, one file on disk. The real filename exists only
#     in the FINAL redirect URL's path, percent-encoded. Hence the HEAD pass below.
#
#  2. CurseForge answers rate-limits and dead file IDs with an HTML error page at HTTP 200. A 3 KB "<html>" named
#     *.jar lands in mods/, is silently ignored by discovery (no loader manifest), and the mod is simply absent
#     with no log line anywhere. Every artifact is therefore validated as a real archive before it counts.
#
# Jars are classified STRUCTURALLY, by what manifest they carry, never by filename — a pack's manifest freely
# mixes mods with Iris shaderpacks, and a shaderpack dropped into mods/ is ignored in silence.
