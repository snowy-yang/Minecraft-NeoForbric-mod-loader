# M18 gate — the three ecosystems can SEE each other.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Every mod that integrates with another mod starts by asking its own loader "is X installed",
# and branches on the answer. In this instance each loader keeps its own list, so that question used to be
# answered per-family: a NeoForge mod was told a Fabric Sodium was absent, and a Fabric mod was told a NeoForge
# JEI was absent. The damage is not a missing name in a menu — it is the branch. Physics Mod asks exactly this
# (LoadingModList.getModFileById("sodium")), was told no while Sodium really had replaced the chunk pipeline, and
# went on rendering its debris and ragdolls into a path Sodium no longer runs: loaded, mixins applied, no error
# anywhere, and nothing on screen.
#
# So this gate asserts the ANSWER, from inside real mods, in both directions, in one instance — and runs the same
# instance again with -Dneoforbric.crossEcosystemPresence=off as the negative control, because an assertion that
# something is true is worth little unless the run that should make it false does.
