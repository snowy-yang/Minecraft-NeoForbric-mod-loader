# Iteratively discovers every guest mixin that cannot apply to the merged base, producing an EXPLICIT list.
#
# Why iteratively: with strict injection requirements (-Dneoforbric.mixinDiagnostics) Mixin reports the FIRST
# misfitting injection and dies — an InjectionError escapes as a fatal MixinTransformerError, so `required: false`
# (which soft-skips apply-time errors) cannot catch it. So: boot, read the failure, add it to the suppression
# list, boot again. Each round reveals exactly one more.
#
# The output list is the honest alternative to relaxing injection requirements globally: relaxing makes a
# non-matching injection SILENT, which is how fabric-registry-sync's half-applied ScopedValue re-bind hid until it
# crashed on a worker thread at runtime.

# Usage: ./mixin-inventory.sh [max-rounds]   (default 12)
