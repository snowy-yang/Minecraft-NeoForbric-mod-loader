# M50 — lithostitched's load predicates are read again with its Fabric build installed.
#
# lithostitched (Fabric build) skips a registry entry whose "predicate" fails, from an @Inject on vanilla's
# Decoder.parse in RegistryLoadTask.PendingRegistration.loadFromResource. NeoForge's merged body decodes through
# ConditionalOps' Codec.parse — the same method, which Mixin's owner match did not see — so every gated entry loaded:
# datapack and mod content meant only for when another mod is present (Tectonic's compat modifiers) always applied,
# giving unwanted worldgen or a registry error that blocks the world. MixinSubtypeOwnerRetarget moves the anchor to
# that one Codec.parse. A dedicated server with the unmodified lithostitched Fabric jar (and fabric-api, which it uses
# undeclared) and a NeoForge mod whose data has
# three configured features: gated by a failing predicate (an absent mod), gated by a holding one (the mod itself),
# and plain (canary/load-predicates).
#
#   1. positive — the failing one is skipped, the other two load.
#   2. off — -Dneoforbric.mixinSubtypeOwner=off: the failing one loads too.
