# M46 — a Fabric mod's injector that Mixin binds to a merge-added delegating stub reaches the body again.
#
# Mixin binds a selector without a descriptor to the FIRST declared method of that name. A carrier that widened a vanilla
# method kept vanilla's signature in front as a stub — Player.getDestroySpeed(BlockState) forwards to NeoForge's
# getDestroySpeed(BlockState, BlockPos), which is what the game calls — so a Fabric mod's injection landed on a method
# nothing calls (architectury's and Collective's break-speed events never fired), and an anchor inside the body was
# simply missing (Fabric API's elytra check reads a field only canGlide(boolean) has). MixinStubRebind moves a
# Fabric mod's injector along carrier-stubs.txt to the body, wrapping a handler that captures the stub's arguments.
# A dedicated server with a Fabric mixin mod compiled against vanilla (canary/stub-rebind/fabric-mixins: a name-only
# RETURN on getDestroySpeed capturing the state, sevenfold on sponge; a name-only HEAD on randomTeleport, cancelling for
# a tagged entity), the unmodified fabric-entity-events-v1, and a NeoForge driver that calls the methods the way the
# merged game does:
#   dirt speed (control), sponge speed through the moved and wrapped injection; an untagged teleport (control), a tagged
#   one cancelled through the moved injection; a language file read through vanilla's rewrite (control) and the mod's
#   prefixed format kept through malilib's @ModifyArgs shape, whose stub passes a non-capturing lambda (a constant) to
#   NeoForge's three-argument body, and an object entry still reaching the component consumer. Fabric API's elytra check has ONE owner: the rebind runs after every
#   specific adapter, so FabricEntityMixinAnchors has already put it at NeoForge's gliding decision (M37 proves the
#   callbacks) and the rebind must leave it alone — moving it too would bind it twice.
#
#   1. positive — STRICT, every case passes, zero confirmed required findings.
#   2. off — -Dneoforbric.mixinStubRebind=off: exactly the three moved cases fail and the controls hold.
# Not covered here: a client (litematica, Sodium, Iris and the model-loading API's moves are client-side).
