# M8 gate — a multiloader mod's pack.mcmeta must not delete its own resource pack on a tri-ecosystem instance.
#
# lithostitched and Terralith are FABRIC-ONLY builds whose pack.mcmeta ships both a fabric:overlays and a
# neoforge:overlays section (one source tree, every platform's section in one file). On stock Fabric the NeoForge
# section is never read. On NeoForbric all three parsers are live, so NeoForge's reads it, tries to resolve
# "lithostitched:breaks_seed_parity" in the neoforge:condition_codecs registry — where the Fabric build never
# registered it — and throws. Pack.readPackMetadata catches Exception across its whole body and returns null, so
# that ONE optional section silently dropped BOTH packs: lithostitched's template_list data never loaded,
# TemplateLists.getRandom called Optional.get() on an empty registry, and ruined-portal chunk generation killed the
# client about twelve seconds after the player joined.
#
# PackMetadataFailSoftInjector + KernelPackMetadata make an unparseable namespaced section read as ABSENT, which is
# exactly what a loader without a parser for it does. This gate is server-side because the crash was: the pack read
# and the worldgen that depended on it both run on the integrated server.
#
# Note on coverage: at level-seed=neoforbrickernel the "no chunk-gen failure" assertion HAD real teeth — verified when
# this gate was written by running it with -Dneoforbric.packMetadataFailSoft=off, which reproduced 6 dropped packs
# and the chunk-gen exception. Since the NeoForge condition leniency landed the neoforge:overlays section PARSES,
# so fail-soft no longer fires here and that switch no longer reproduces the crash (re-run 2026-09-20: only the
# two config-dependent checks move). The seed stays fixed for the chunk-gen assertion (it needs a ruined portal in
# the generated region); the pack assertions are seed-independent and are what gates the fix.
#
# M8_EXTRA_JVM is how this gate's other teeth are demonstrated. -Dneoforbric.neoConditions=off: Terralith's data files
# carry `neoforge:conditions` of type terralith:config (registered only on Fabric), so NeoForge's strict codec errors
# on every one. Observed: 'the unknown condition type was tolerated' and 'a foreign skip marker was converted' go
# RED (the strict error propagates instead of the kernel's tolerance lines); the server still reaches Done, because
# PackMetadataFailSoft and the Fabric-dialect section carry the same packs through — the RED is the two lines.
# -Dneoforbric.overlayConditions=off: the veto and the NOT-mounted checks go RED (recorded below the checks).
