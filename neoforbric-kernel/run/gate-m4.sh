# M4 gate — TRI-IN-ONE server with REAL third-party mods (not synthetic canaries): Fabric + traditional
# MinecraftForge + NeoForge all live SIMULTANEOUSLY in ONE instance on the merged 3-ABI base, with no genuine
# loader lifecycle for any of them.
#
# The proof is real mods registering real content, one ecosystem per family, all at once:
#   • Fabric         fabric-api (38 JiJ modules) + Jade — main entrypoints run, Jade registers content + loads its
#                    server plugins
#   • MinecraftForge FIVE Forge-only real mods — mcw-bridges, spark, TerraBlender, GeckoLib, NoChatReports —
#                    all construct on genuine FMLJavaModLoadingContexts; Macaw's registers 303 blocks/items,
#                    GeckoLib registers its own content
#   • NeoForge       the genuine NeoForge baseline (NeoForgeMod, 35 entries + its internal @EventBusSubscribers)
#                    PLUS real third-party NeoForge @Mods: FallingTree and collective are UNIVERSAL jars (they ship
#                    fabric.mod.json + mods.toml + neoforge.mods.toml and one glue class per family). All three
#                    loaders are live here, so MultiLoaderArbiter claims each jar for exactly ONE family — NeoForge
#                    by default — and suppresses the other two. Without it the same mod initialised THREE times.
#                    So all three families run real third-party mod code, none of it synthetic, none of it twice.
#
# `collective` is the reason guest-config relaxation had to be generalised: its Forge jar ALSO ships a Fabric mixin
# config (collective_fabric.mixins.json) whose PlayerMixin descriptor no longer matches the merged base. While the
# launch scripts relaxed only `fabric-*`, that was a FATAL MixinApplyError that aborted the boot; the kernel now
# relaxes every discovered guest mod's configs, so it soft-skips with a warning and the mod still loads.
#
# Both game-event families ticking 1:1 in the same loop (the B-5 shape, past all public prior art) is proven by the
# kernel's GameEventMultiplexer: it subscribes to NeoForge's ServerTickEvent (the surviving merged hook) and
# re-emits MinecraftForge's, logging once at 20 forwards — so 20 forwards means both families ticked 20 times, once
# each. Real mods don't count ticks, so this proof is kernel-instrumented rather than canary-emitted.
