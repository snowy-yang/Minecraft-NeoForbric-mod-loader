# M17 gate — the installer produces a version an ordinary Minecraft launcher can start.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Every other gate calls run/launch-kernel-client.sh, which builds the java command by hand from
# paths in this checkout. That proves the kernel runs; it proves nothing about the thing a user actually installs.
# Between the two sits the whole surface the installer owns: which jars are staged where, what the version profile
# says, and whether a launcher reading Mojang's format can turn that profile back into the same command.
#
# So this gate never calls the launch script. It installs into an empty directory, then RESOLVES the profile the
# way a launcher does — follow inheritsFrom, merge libraries and arguments, expand ${library_directory} and the
# rest, build the classpath — and runs what comes out. A profile that names a jar the installer forgot to stage,
# or an argument the kernel cannot parse, fails here and nowhere else.
#
# The world, the assets and the LWJGL natives come from the real Minecraft install, exactly as a launcher would
# supply them. The install directory itself is fresh every run.
