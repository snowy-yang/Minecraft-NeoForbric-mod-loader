# M4-CANARY gate (synthetic) — TRI-IN-ONE server: Fabric + traditional MinecraftForge + NeoForge mods run SIMULTANEOUSLY in ONE
# instance on the merged 3-ABI base, with no genuine loader lifecycle for any of them.
#
# The proof is three canaries, one per ecosystem, all live at once:
#   • Fabric      neoforbricfabriclive — entrypoints run, JiJ nested mod runs, content registered survives the freeze
#   • NeoForge    neoforbricneolive    — @Mod constructed, ServerTickEvent fires NATIVELY (Neo won the merged tick hook)
#   • MinecraftForge neoforbriclive    — @Mod constructed, @EventBusSubscriber registered, ServerTickEvent fires via the
#                                     GameEventMultiplexer (Neo→Forge 1:1 re-emission)
#
# Both tick canaries firing in the same server loop is the B-5 shape: the merged tick hook reaches BOTH families,
# once each, no double-fire. This is past all public prior art (Connector/Kilt/ReForged are 2-ecosystem).
