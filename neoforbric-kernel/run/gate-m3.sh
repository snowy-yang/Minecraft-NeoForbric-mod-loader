# On the merged base the kernel: constructs the NeoForge baseline mod (NeoForgeMod) AND the traditional-Forge
# baseline mod (ForgeMod) via the container factory + UnsafeHacks, fires each family's RegisterEvent so their
# default content registers (e.g. the empty fluid types EntityFluidInteraction reads for every entity), and
# constructs a discovered real @Mod (its own ctor runs) — all with no genuine FancyModLoader/FML lifecycle. Then
# the server reaches Done, ticks, and shuts down cleanly.
