# M10 gate — two CORRECT pack patches must not collide into a pack that cannot be read.
#
# Tectonic's builtin pack ships one pack.mcmeta carrying a vanilla `overlays`, a `fabric:overlays` AND a
# `neoforge:overlays` — one source tree, every platform's section in one file. On a stock instance exactly one of
# those parsers is live. On NeoForbric all three are, and the two loader patches meet in Pack.readPackMetadata:
#
#   NeoForge's patch:  overlaySet = new ArrayList<>(overlaySet); overlaySet.addAll(neoOverlays);
#   fabric-api's mixin: @ModifyVariable(method="readPackMetadata", at=@At("STORE"), name="overlaySet")
#                       … and its handler always returns List.copyOf(…)
#
# So NeoForge asks an immutable list to addAll and gets UnsupportedOperationException. readPackMetadata catches
# Exception across its whole body, returns null, and Tectonic's RepositorySource hands that null straight to
# PackRepository.discoverAvailable, which NPEs on it. Neither mod is wrong; the collision exists only on a base
# that carries both patches at once. It cost a world load, and the symptom named Tectonic — a mod that is doing
# nothing unusual — so it is worth a gate of its own.
#
# PackOverlayMutabilityInjector rewrites the in-place merge into a copying one WITHOUT adding or removing an
# `ASTORE overlaySet`, so fabric-api's un-ordinal'd mixin still binds to exactly the same site set and the repair
# is invisible to it. NullPackGuardInjector is the second layer: if that anchor ever stops matching, a null pack
# is skipped with a warning instead of taking the repository down.
#
# WHY NOT FOLD THIS INTO M8. M8's mod set is deliberately pure-Fabric builds, and its chunk-gen tripwire is
# calibrated to level-seed=neoforbrickernel. Tectonic is a NeoForge build that rewrites overworld noise settings, so
# staging it there would both change the terrain the tripwire depends on and pull lithostitched over to the
# NeoForge side of arbitration, silently gutting M8's Fabric half. Different mod set, different gate.
#
# THE SECOND THING THIS GATE HOLDS. Getting Tectonic's pack read is not the same as getting lithostitched's data
# loaded, and this mod set proved they are different problems. The kernel publishes mods into ModList with
# setLoadedMods, which leaves ModList.modFiles EMPTY, so NeoForge's own mod-pack finder — findResourcePacks() over
# getModFiles() — walks an empty list and not one Forge-family mod's data/ is ever read. Fabric builds were never
# affected, because fabric-api serves those from Fabric's mod list, so every gate that checked datapack content
# happened to miss it. Measured: lithostitched's Fabric and NeoForge builds ship byte-identical data/ trees; at this
# seed with this fabric-api the Fabric build reaches Done and the NeoForge build dies generating the first ruined
# portal on an empty lithostitched:template_list. DataPackHookInjector + KernelDataPacks close that.
#
# The teeth are demonstrable, which is the only reason to trust them:
#   M10_EXTRA_JVM="-Dneoforbric.packRepair=off"    ./run/gate-m10-overlay.sh   # must go RED (the overlay collision)
#   M10_EXTRA_JVM="-Dneoforbric.modDataPacks=off"  ./run/gate-m10-overlay.sh   # must go RED (the unserved data/)
# GATE-PARALLEL: rundirs=server-overlay mem=2000

# writes the root registry from a NeoForge mod's constructor and fails "Registry is already frozen". That is the
# mod set being wrong, not the kernel: on a real NeoForge instance Tectonic gets the NeoForge build too.
