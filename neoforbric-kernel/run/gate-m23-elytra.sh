# M23 gate — an elytra enters flight AND stays in it.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The merge split one mechanism down the middle: it took NeoForge's LivingEntity.canGlide, which
# decides gliding from the neoforge:gliding_flight attribute and never looks at the item, and vanilla's
# ItemStack.forEachModifier, which reads the raw component instead of calling the method that posts the event
# NeoForge's own listener answers. The listener is the only thing anywhere that raises that attribute. Producer on
# one side of the merge, consumer on the other, attribute stuck at its false default.
#
# WHY IT ASSERTS SUSTAIN AND NOT JUST START. canGlide being false did not stop flight from starting — it made
# updateFallFlying clear the flag on the very next tick, so a player got a moment of flight and was pulled back.
# A gate that only asked "did flight start" would have passed on the broken build. This one gives
# updateFallFlying forty chances to cancel it and then asks again.
#
# WHY THE SERVER'S PLAYER. Equipment attributes are applied server-side (detectEquipmentUpdates casts the level to
# ServerLevel) and flight is server-authoritative. The client only predicts — its own isFallFlying reads true even
# on a build where the server refuses, which is exactly how a broken build can look fixed.

  # WHAT THIS GATE DOES NOT COVER, said here so "elytra gate green" is not read as more than it is: the player
  # does not travel. This harness's client never receives input and its local player's physics does not run --
  # two motion samples 40 ticks apart come back byte-identical -- so distance cannot be measured here, and an
  # assertion on it would be permanently red for a reason that has nothing to do with the repair.
  #
  # What IS covered is the thing that was broken. canGlide being false never stopped flight from starting; it
  # made updateFallFlying clear the flag on the next tick, so the player got a moment of flight and was pulled
  # back. Forty ticks of sustain, asked of the server's own player, is exactly that failure's opposite.
