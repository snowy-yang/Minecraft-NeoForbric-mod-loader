rem Two things this has to survive, both of which look identical to the user -- a black window that flashes
rem and vanishes -- and neither of which is the installer's fault:
rem
rem   1. No Java on PATH. A Minecraft player often has no system-wide JDK at all; the only runtime on the
rem      machine is the one their launcher downloaded under .minecraft\runtime. So look there too.
rem   2. A .jar file association that is missing -jar. Windows' "always open with" dialog produces
rem      `java.exe "%1"`, which makes Java read the jar path as a CLASS NAME, print ClassNotFoundException
rem      and exit before anyone can read it. Launching through this script bypasses the association entirely.
rem
rem Nothing here exits without either starting the installer or leaving a message on screen.
