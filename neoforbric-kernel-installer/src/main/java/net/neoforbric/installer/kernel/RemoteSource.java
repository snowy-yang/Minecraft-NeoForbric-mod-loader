/**
 * The third source a manifest entry can be satisfied from: a published GitHub release, instead of a jar bundled
 * inside this installer or a path on the build machine.
 *
 * <p><b>Where each jar comes from.</b> NeoForbric's own artifacts ({@code net.neoforbric:*}) exist nowhere but the
 * release, so they are fetched from it. Everything else — ASM, Mixin, SAT4J, night-config and the rest — is a
 * third-party library with a canonical home, so it is fetched from Maven (fabricmc.net for {@code net.fabricmc:*},
 * Maven Central otherwise) and only falls back to the release. Publishing someone else's jar under NeoForbric's name
 * would be the wrong default even where the licence permits it.
 *
 * <p><b>What "verified" means here.</b> Every download is checked against the SHA-1 the manifest declares, and an
 * already-present file is only treated as a cache hit when its digest matches — "exists and is non-empty" is not
 * good enough for bytes that arrived over a network, because a truncated download satisfies it forever.
 *
 * <p>That check is only as trustworthy as the manifest, though. A SHA-1 carried in a manifest downloaded from the
 * same release as the jars proves the transfer was not corrupted; it proves nothing about whoever wrote the
 * release, since they would simply publish a matching manifest. The trust anchor is therefore
 * {@code manifestSha256} in {@value #RELEASE_PROPERTIES}, compiled into this installer at build time: when it is
 * present the downloaded manifest must match it, and the per-jar digests inherit that trust. When it is absent
 * (an installer built outside a release), the manifest is trusted on TLS alone and this is said out loud rather
 * than passed over in silence.
